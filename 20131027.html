		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 27 October 2013 </h1><h2> Marcia Wallace</h2><p><b>Marcia Karen Wallace</b> (November 1, 1942 – October 25, 2013) was an American character actress, comedienne and game show panelist, primarily known for her roles in television situation comedies. She is perhaps best known for her roles as receptionist Carol Kester on the 1970s sitcom <i>The Bob Newhart Show</i>, and as the voice of elementary school teacher Edna Krabappel on the animated series <i>The Simpsons</i>, for which she won an Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcia_Wallace' >More...</a><hr><h2> Yesterday</h2><p>"<b>Yesterday</b>" is a song originally recorded by the Beatles for their 1965 album <i>Help!</i>. Although credited to "Lennon–McCartney", the song was written solely by Paul McCartney. It remains popular today with more than 2,200 cover versions, and is one of the most covered songs in the history of recorded music. At the time of its first appearance the song was released by the Beatles' record company as a single in the United States but not in the United Kingdom (for further details see below). Consequently, whilst it topped the American chart in 1965 the song first hit the British top 10 three months after the release of <i>Help!</i> in a cover version by Matt Monro. "Yesterday" was voted the best song of the 20th century in a 1999 BBC Radio 2 poll of music experts and listeners and was also voted the No. 1 Pop song of all time by MTV and <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine the following year. In 1997, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) asserts that it was performed over seven million times in the 20th century alone.</p>
<p>"Yesterday" is a melancholy acoustic guitar ballad about the break-up of a relationship. McCartney is the only Beatle to appear on the recording, and it was the first official recording by the Beatles that relied upon a performance by a single member of the band. He was accompanied by a string quartet. The final recording was so different from other works by the Beatles that the band members vetoed the release of the song as a single in the United Kingdom. (However, it was issued as a single there in 1976.) In 2000 McCartney asked Yoko Ono if she would agree to change the credit on the song to read "McCartney–Lennon" in the <i>The Beatles Anthology</i>, but she refused.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday' >More...</a><hr><h2> Dream of the Rarebit Fiend</h2><p><i><b>Dream of the Rarebit Fiend</b></i> was a newspaper comic strip by American cartoonist Winsor McCay which began September 10, 1904. As in McCay's signature strip, <i>Little Nemo</i>, the strip was made up of bizarre dreams. It was McCay's second successful strip, after <i>Little Sammy Sneeze</i> secured him a position on the cartoon staff of the <i>New York Herald</i>. <i>Rarebit Fiend</i> was printed in the <i>Evening Telegram</i>, a newspaper published by the <i>Herald</i>. For contractual reasons, McCay signed the strip with the pen name "Silas".</p>
<p>The strip had no continuity or recurring characters. Instead, it had a recurring theme: a character would have a nightmare or other bizarre dream, usually after eating a Welsh rarebit (a cheese-on-toast dish). The character would awaken from the dream in the last panel, regretting having eaten the rarebit. The dreams often revealed the darker sides of the dreamers' psyches—their phobias, hypocrisies, discomforts, and dark fantasies. This was in great contrast to the colorful, childlike fantasy dreams in <i>Little Nemo</i>. The strip is mostly recognized as an adult-oriented precursor to <i>Nemo</i>.</p>
<p>The popularity of <i>Rarebit Fiend</i> and <i>Nemo</i> led to McCay being hired for William Randolph Hearst's chain of newspapers with a star's salary. His editor there thought his highly-skilled cartooning was "serious, not funny", and he was made to give up comic strips to do editorial cartooning. The strip was revived 1923–1925 as <i>Rarebit Reveries</i>, though few examples have survived.</p>
<p><i>Rarebit Fiend</i> was the inspiration for a number of films, including Edwin S. Porter's live-action <i>Dream of a Rarebit Fiend</i> in 1906, and four pioneering animated films by McCay himself: <i>How a Mosquito Operates</i> in 1912, and 1921's <i>Bug Vaudeville</i>, <i>The Pet</i> and <i>The Flying House</i>. The strip is said to have anticipated a number of recurring ideas in popular culture, such as giant characters damaging cities (as later popularized by <i>King Kong</i> and <i>Godzilla</i>).</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Rarebit_Fiend' >More...</a><hr><h2> Hobo</h2><p>A <b>hobo</b> is a migratory worker or homeless vagabond—especially one who is penniless. The term originated in the Western—probably Northwestern—United States around 1890. Unlike "tramps"—who work only when they are forced to and, "bums"—who do not work at all, "hobos" are itinerant workers.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo' >More...</a><hr><h2> Edna Krabappel</h2><p><b>Edna Krabappel</b> /krəˈbɑːpəl/ is a fictional character from the animated TV series <i>The Simpsons</i>, who was voiced by Marcia Wallace. She is the teacher of Bart Simpson's 4th grade class at Springfield Elementary School, and Ned Flanders's wife in later seasons. Krabappel was the only character Wallace voiced on a regular basis. The show's producers intend to retire the character following Wallace's death.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edna_Krabappel' >More...</a><hr><h2> Milkha Singh</h2><p><b>Milkha Singh</b> (born 1935), also known as <i><b>The Flying Sikh</b></i>, is a former Indian track and field sprinter who was introduced to the sport while serving in the Indian Army. As of 2013, he is the only Indian male athlete to win an individual athletics gold medal at a Commonwealth Games. He represented India in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. He was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in recognition of his sporting achievements.</p>
<p>The race for which Singh is best remembered is his fourth-place finish in the 400 metres final at the 1960 Olympic Games, which he had entered as one of the favourites. He led the race for some time before easing off, allowing others to pass him. Various records were broken in the race, which required a photo-finish and saw American Otis Davis being declared the winner by one-hundredth of a second over German Carl Kaufmann. Singh's fourth-place time of 45.73 became the Indian national record and held for almost 40 years.</p>
<p>From beginnings that saw him orphaned and displaced during the Partition of India, Singh has become a sporting icon in his country. In 2008, journalist Rohit Brijnath described Singh as "the finest athlete India has ever produced". In July 2012, <i>The Independent</i> said that "India's most revered Olympian is a gallant loser" and noted the paucity of success — 20 medals — achieved by Indian competitors in the Olympic Games despite the country having a population in excess of one billion.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkha_Singh' >More...</a><hr><h2> Daylight saving time</h2><p><b>Daylight saving time</b> (<b>DST</b>)—also <b>summer time</b> in British English— is the practice of advancing clocks during the lighter months so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less. Typically clocks are adjusted forward one hour near the start of spring and are adjusted backward in autumn.</p>
<p>The modern idea of daylight saving was first proposed in 1895 by George Vernon Hudson  and it was first implemented by Germany and Austria-Hungary starting on 30 April 1916. Many countries have used it at various times since then. Much of the United States used DST in the 1950s and 1960s, and DST use expanded following the 1970s energy crisis. It has been widely used in North America and Europe since then.</p>
<p>The practice has been both praised and criticized. Adding daylight to evenings benefits retailing, sports, and other activities that exploit sunlight after working hours, but can cause problems for evening entertainment and other occupations tied to the sun (such as farming) or to darkness (such as drive-in theatres). Although an early goal of DST was to reduce evening use of incandescent lighting (formerly a primary use of electricity), modern heating and cooling usage patterns differ greatly, and research about how DST currently affects energy use is limited or contradictory.</p>
<p>DST clock shifts present other challenges. They complicate timekeeping, and can disrupt meetings, travel, billing, record keeping, medical devices, heavy equipment, and sleep patterns. Software can often adjust computer clocks automatically, but this can be limited and error-prone, particularly when DST dates are changed.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time' >More...</a><hr><h2> Sex</h2><p>Organisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a <b>sex</b>. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy). By definition, male gametes are small, motile, and optimized to transport their genetic information over a distance, while female gametes are large, non-motile and contain the nutrients necessary for the early development of the young organism. Typically, males carry XY chromosomes, whereas females carry XX chromosomes.</p>
<p>The gametes produced by an organism determine its sex: males produce male gametes (spermatozoa, or sperm, in animals; pollen in plants) while females produce female gametes (ova, or egg cells); individual organisms which produce both male and female gametes are termed hermaphroditic. Frequently, physical differences are associated with the different sexes of an organism; these sexual dimorphisms can reflect the different reproductive pressures the sexes experience.</p>
