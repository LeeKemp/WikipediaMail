		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 24 January 2014 </h1><h2> Justin Bieber</h2><p><b>Justin Drew Bieber</b> (/ˈbiːbər/; born March 1, 1994) is a Canadian pop musician, actor, and singer-songwriter. Bieber was discovered in 2008 by American talent manager Scooter Braun, who came across Bieber's videos on YouTube and later became his manager. Braun arranged for him to meet with entertainer Usher Raymond in Atlanta, Georgia. Bieber was signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), and then to an Island Records recording contract offered by record executive L.A. Reid.</p>
<p>His debut extended play, the seven-track <i>My World</i>, was released in November 2009, and was certified platinum in the United States. He became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record to chart on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Bieber's first full-length studio album, <i>My World 2.0</i>, was released in March 2010. It debuted at or near number-one in several countries and was certified platinum in the United States. It was preceded by the single "Baby". He followed up the release of his debut album with his first headlining tour, the My World Tour, the remix albums <i>My Worlds Acoustic</i> and <i>Never Say Never – The Remixes</i>, and the 3D biopic-concert film <i>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</i>. Bieber released his second studio album <i>Under the Mistletoe</i> in November 2011, when it debuted at number-one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Bieber released his third studio album <i>Believe</i> on June 19, 2012, and it became his fourth chart topper in the United States, debuting at number-one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200.</p>
<p>Bieber has received numerous awards, including both Artist of the Year Awards, at the 2010 American Music Awards, and the 2012 American Music Awards, and was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 53rd Grammy Awards. With a global fan base, termed as "Beliebers", and over 40 million followers on Twitter, he was named by <i>Forbes</i> magazine in 2012 as the third-most powerful celebrity in the world. He had earned an estimated US$55 million in the previous 12 months. As of May 2012, Bieber had sold 15 million albums.</p>

It is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the International Whaling Commission as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal competency for small cetaceans. Around 950 Long-finned Pilot Whales (<i>Globicephala melaena</i>), sometimes erroneously called <i>Calderon Dolphins</i>, are killed annually, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called <i>grindadráp</i> in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. The hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats. The boats then drive the pilot whales slowly into a bay or to the bottom of a fjord.</p>
<p>Many Faroese consider the hunt an important part of their culture and history. Animal-rights groups criticize the hunt as being cruel and unnecessary. As of the end of November 2008 the chief medical officers of the Faroe Islands have recommended that pilot whales no longer be considered fit for human consumption because of the level of mercury in the whales.</p>

As well as representing the Egyptian national team at an early age, he also participated in 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2012 Summer Olympics. He won the Swiss Super League in his first season with Basel, and was awarded the CAF Most Promising African Talent of the Year in 2012 CAF Awards.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah' >More...</a><hr><h2> Pinkerton (album)</h2><p><i><b>Pinkerton</b></i> is the second studio album by American alternative rock band Weezer, released on September 24, 1996 on DGC Records. After discarding initial plans for a space-themed rock opera entitled <i>Songs from the Black Hole</i>, the group recorded <i>Pinkerton</i> in between vocalist/guitarist Rivers Cuomo's stints at Harvard University. Much of the album was written by Cuomo while he was away at school. To assist in capturing the group's live sound, Weezer decided against hiring a producer for <i>Pinkerton</i>.</p>
<p>The record used a darker, more abrasive sound in comparison to the band's debut album, <i>Weezer</i>, with themes drawn from Cuomo's disillusionment with the rock lifestyle. <i>Pinkerton</i> is named after the character B.F. Pinkerton from Giacomo Puccini's opera <i>Madame Butterfly</i>, and the album plays as a concept album based loosely around the opera. Like the opera, the record contains many references to Japan and Japanese culture.</p>
<p><i>Pinkerton</i> debuted at number 19 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and fell far short of sales expectations after the success of the band's debut, <i>Weezer</i> (1994). The record spawned three singles, two of which were released in an attempt to save the album commercially: "El Scorcho", "The Good Life" and "Pink Triangle". Despite receiving negative reviews from critics upon its release, the album went on to achieve cult status and wide acclaim years after its release; the 2010 "Deluxe Edition" reissue holds a perfect score on aggregate review website Metacritic. It was the last Weezer album to feature bassist Matt Sharp.</p>

He is considered one of the greatest players of all time. His success on clay has earned him the nickname "King of Clay" and has led many sports journalists and commentators, as well as former and current players, to regard him as the greatest clay court player in history.</p>
<p>Nadal has won 13 Grand Slam singles titles, the 2008 Olympic gold medal in singles, a record 26 ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and a record 14 ATP World Tour 500 tournaments. He was also a member of the winning Spain Davis Cup team in 2004, 2008, 2009, and 2011. In 2010, he became the seventh player in history and youngest of four in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam. He is only the second male player, after Andre Agassi, to complete the singles Career Golden Slam.</p>
<p>Nadal and Mats Wilander are the only players in history who have won at least two Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces—hard court, grass, and clay. By winning the 2013 French Open, Nadal became the only male player to win a single Grand Slam tournament eight times and the first to win at least one Grand Slam tournament for nine consecutive years, breaking the record of eight previously shared by Björn Borg, Pete Sampras, and Roger Federer. Nadal holds the record for most consecutive titles at a particular tournament as a result of winning his eighth straight Monte-Carlo Masters in 2012.</p>
<p>He is the first Spanish player, male or female, to rank No. 1 for more than 100 weeks. He is the only Spanish player, male or female, to have won the career golden slam, the first Spanish male player to win the Australian Open and the second Spanish male player to have won Wimbledon and the US Open.</p>

It provides a perpetual calendar since the Gregorian calendar moves in cycles of 400 years.</p>
<p>This algorithm for mental calculation was devised by John Conway after drawing inspiration from Lewis Carroll's work on a perpetual calendar algorithm. It takes advantage of the fact that each year has a certain day of the week (the <i>doomsday</i>) upon which certain easy-to-remember dates fall; for example, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12, and the last day of February all occur on the same day of the week in any given year. Applying the Doomsday algorithm involves three steps:</p>
<ol><li>Determine the "anchor day" for the century.</li>
<li>Use the anchor day for the century to calculate the doomsday for the year.</li>
<li>Choose the closest date out of the ones that always fall on the doomsday (e.g. 4/4, 6/6, 8/8), and count the number of days (modulo 7) between that date and the date in question to arrive at the day of the week.</li>
</ol><p>This technique applies to both the Gregorian calendar A.D. and the Julian calendar, although their doomsdays will usually be different days of the week.</p>
<p>Since this algorithm involves treating days of the week like numbers modulo 7, John Conway suggests thinking of the days of the week as "Noneday" or "Sansday" (for Sunday), "Oneday", "Twosday", "Treblesday", "Foursday", "Fiveday", and "Six-a-day".</p>
<p>The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on.</p>
