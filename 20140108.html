		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 08 January 2014 </h1><h2> Alliance (Firefly)</h2><p>The <b>Alliance</b> is a fictional corporate supergovernment in the <i>Serenity</i> franchise, a powerful authoritarian government and law-enforcement organization that controls the majority of territory within the known universe. Originally composed solely of a number of "core worlds", several years prior to the show's timeframe the Alliance fought the Unification War to bring all colonized worlds under its control. The Independent Faction (Browncoats) wanted the outer worlds to remain autonomous and attempted to resist Alliance control. The war raged for several years, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides, until the Alliance emerged victorious. An armistice was signed between the Alliance and the Independent Faction, thus ending the war and securing Alliance control over the entirety of the system.</p>

In 1933, almost two years after her death, Tanzler removed Hoyos's body from its tomb, and lived with the corpse at his home for seven years until its discovery by Hoyos's relatives and authorities in 1940.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Tanzler' >More...</a><hr><h2> Dennis Rodman</h2><p><b>Dennis Keith Rodman</b> (born May 13, 1961) is a retired American Hall of Fame professional basketball player, who played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, and Dallas Mavericks in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Born in Trenton, New Jersey, he was nicknamed "<b>The Worm</b>" and was known for his fierce defensive and rebounding abilities.</p>
<p>Rodman played at the small forward position in his early years before becoming a power forward. He earned NBA All-Defensive First Team honors seven times and won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice. He also led the NBA in rebounds per game for a record seven consecutive years and won five NBA championships. His biography at NBA.com states that he is "arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history." On April 1, 2011, the Pistons retired Rodman's No. 10 jersey, and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame later that year.</p>
<p>Rodman experienced an unhappy childhood and was shy and introverted in his early years. After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993, he reinvented himself as a "bad boy" and became notorious for numerous controversial antics. He repeatedly dyed his hair in artificial colors, had many piercings and tattoos, and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials. He famously wore a wedding dress to promote his 1996 autobiography <i>Bad As I Wanna Be</i>. Rodman pursued a high-profile affair with singer Madonna and was briefly married to actress Carmen Electra.</p>
<p>Apart from basketball, Rodman is a retired part-time professional wrestler and actor. He was a member of the nWo and fought alongside Hulk Hogan at two <i>Bash at the Beach</i> events. He had his own TV show <i>The Rodman World Tour</i>, and had lead roles in the action films <i>Simon Sez</i> and <i>Double Team</i> alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme. Both films were critically panned, with the latter earning Rodman a triple Razzie Award. He appeared in several reality TV series and was the winner of the $222,000 main prize of the 2004 edition of <i>Celebrity Mole</i>. Rodman won the first ever Celebrity Championship Wrestling tournament.</p>

<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B3nica_Spear' >More...</a><hr><h2> Keith Moon</h2><p><b>Keith John Moon</b> (23 August 1946 – 7 September 1978) was an English musician best known as the drummer of the English rock group the Who. He was noted for his unique drumming style and his eccentric, often self-destructive behaviour. In 2011, Moon was voted the second-greatest drummer in history by a <i>Rolling Stone</i> readers' poll. Thirty-five years after his death, his drumming is still praised by critics and musicians.</p>
<p>Moon grew up in Wembley, northwest London, and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After playing with a local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they recorded their first single. Moon remained with the band during their rise to fame, and was quickly recognised for his distinctive drumming style. He occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation and remained a member of the band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, however, Moon developed a reputation for smashing his kit onstage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated by blowing up toilets with cherry bombs or dynamite, and by destroying television sets. Moon enjoyed touring and socialising, and was bored and restless when the Who were inactive. His twenty-first birthday party in Flint, Michigan has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups.</p>
<p>Moon suffered a number of setbacks during the 1970s, most notably the accidental death of chauffeur Neil Boland and the breakdown of his marriage. He became addicted to alcohol (particularly brandy and champagne), acquiring a reputation for decadence and dark humour; his nickname was "Moon the Loon". After moving to Los Angeles with personal assistant Peter "Dougal" Butler during the mid-1970s Moon recorded his only solo album, the poorly received <i>Two Sides of the Moon</i>. While touring with the Who, on several occasions he passed out on stage and was hospitalised. By their final tour in 1976 (and particularly during the filming of <i>The Kids Are Alright</i> and the recording of <i>Who Are You</i>), the drummer's deterioration was evident. Moon moved back to London in 1978, dying in September of that year from an overdose of Heminevrin (a drug intended to curb alcohol abuse).</p>

In April 2013, he was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. Bae is the longest-serving United States prisoner of North Korea since the end of the Korean War.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Bae' >More...</a><hr><h2> Human</h2><p><b>Humans</b> (variously <i>Homo sapiens</i> and <i>Homo sapiens sapiens</i>) are primates of the family Hominidae, and the only extant species of the genus <i>Homo</i>. Humans are distinguished from other primates by their bipedal locomotion, and especially by their relatively larger brain with its particularly well developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which enable high levels of abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, and culture through social learning. Humans use tools to a much higher degree than any other animal, and are the only extant species known to build fires and cook their food, as well as the only known species to clothe themselves and create and use numerous other technologies and arts. The scientific study of humans is the discipline of anthropology.</p>
<p>Humans are uniquely adept at utilizing systems of symbolic communication such as language and art for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and organization. Humans create complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to states. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values, social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human society. The human desire to understand and influence their environment, and explain and manipulate phenomena, has been the foundation for the development of science, philosophy, mythology, and religion.</p>
<p>The human lineage diverged from the last common ancestor with its closest living relative, the chimpanzee, some five million years ago, evolving into the australopithecines and eventually the genus <i>Homo</i>. The first <i>Homo</i> species to move out of Africa was <i>Homo erectus</i>, the African variety of which, together with <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i>, is considered to be the immediate ancestor of modern humans. <i>Homo sapiens</i> originated in Africa, where it reached anatomical modernity about 200,000 years ago and began to exhibit full behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago. <i>Homo sapiens</i> proceeded to colonize the continents, arriving in Eurasia 125,000–60,000 years ago, Australia around 40,000 years ago, the Americas around 15,000 years ago, and remote islands such as Hawaii, Easter Island, Madagascar, and New Zealand between the years AD 300 and 1280.</p>
<p>Humans began to practice sedentary agriculture about 12,000 years ago, domesticating plants and animals which allowed for the growth of civilization. Humans subsequently established various forms of government, religion, and culture around the world, unifying people within a region and leading to the development of states and empires. The rapid advancement of scientific and medical understanding in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the development of fuel-driven technologies and improved health, causing the human population to rise exponentially. With individuals widespread in every continent except Antarctica, humans are a cosmopolitan species. By 2012 the global human population was estimated to be around 7 billion.</p>
