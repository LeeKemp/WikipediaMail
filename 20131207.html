		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 07 December 2013 </h1><h2> 2014 FIFA World Cup</h2><p>The <b>2014 FIFA World Cup</b> will be the 20th FIFA World Cup, an international men's football tournament, that is scheduled to take place in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July 2014. It will be the second time that Brazil has hosted the competition, the previous being in 1950. Brazil was elected unchallenged as host nation in 2007 after the international football federation, FIFA, decreed that the tournament would be staged in South America for the first time since 1978 in Argentina.</p>
<p>The national teams of 31 countries advanced through qualification competitions that began in June 2011 to participate with the host nation Brazil in the final tournament. A total of 64 matches are to be played in twelve cities across Brazil in either new or redeveloped stadiums, with the tournament beginning with a group stage. For the first time at a World Cup Finals, the matches will use goal-line technology.</p>
<p>Spain is the defending champion, having defeated the Netherlands 1â€“0 in the 2010 World Cup final to win its first World title. The previous four World Cups staged in South America were all won by South American teams.</p>

The ring finger and thumb are curled or bent down while the other fingers are extended. The index and middle fingers are kept together (touching) and the back of the hand faces outwards (away from the gesturer). The gesture refers to the act of inserting the index and middle fingers into a vagina and the little finger into the receiver's anus, hence the "shock".</p>
<p>Because the athletic teams of the Wichita State University are nicknamed "the Shockers" (short for "Wheatshockers," an unrelated term), fans at basketball games, use a modified form of the gesture by extending the thumb to form a "W". On her 2006 album <i>Impeach My Bush</i>, Canadian electroclash artist Peaches outlined the gesture as "thumbs up, fingers out, pull back" in the song "Rock the Shocker". The Glam Metal band Steel Panther released a track on their 2009 album <i>Feel the Steel</i> named "The Shocker".</p>
<p>In March 2011, Australian Football League player Jarryd Blair was seen making what was thought to be the gesture in the Collingwood team photo after their NAB Cup Grand Final win, leading to a brief media outcry and formal apology.</p>

The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II.</p>
<p>The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. There were simultaneous Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the defenders, the attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time. The base was attacked by 353 Japanese fighters, bombers and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers. All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four being sunk. All but one were later raised, and six of the eight battleships returned to service and fought in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer. 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,402 Americans were killed and 1,282 wounded. Important base installations such as the power station, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 65 servicemen killed or wounded. One Japanese sailor was captured.</p>
<p>The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day (December 8), the United States declared war on Japan. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been strong, disappeared. Clandestine support of Britain (for example the Neutrality Patrol) was replaced by active alliance. Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day.</p>
<p>There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan. However, the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, "a date which will live in infamy".</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-12-07 11:30:14 -0500 -->
