		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 03 May 2014 </h1><h2> Jersey Videographer</h2><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Videographer' >More...</a><hr><h2> Cinco de Mayo</h2><p><b>Cinco de Mayo</b> (Spanish for "fifth of May") is a celebration held on <b>May 5</b>. It is celebrated in the United States and in Mexico, primarily in the state of Puebla, where the holiday is called <i>El Día de la Batalla de Puebla</i> (English: The Day of the Battle of Puebla).</p>
<p>It originated with Mexican-American communities in the American West as a way to commemorate the cause of freedom and democracy during the first years of the American Civil War, and today the date is observed in the United States as a celebration of Mexican heritage and pride. In the state of Puebla, the date is observed to commemorate the Mexican army's unlikely victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, under the leadership of General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguín. Cinco de Mayo is not Mexico's Independence Day—the most important national patriotic holiday in Mexico—which is celebrated on September 16.</p>

Noted for his deadpan and slightly stammering delivery, Newhart came to prominence in the 1960s when his album of comedic monologues <i>The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart</i> was a worldwide bestseller and reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> pop album chart—it remains the 20th best-selling comedy album in history. The follow-up album, <i>The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!</i> was also a massive success, and the two albums held the <i>Billboard</i> number one and number two spots simultaneously.</p>
<p>Newhart later went into acting, starring in two long-running and prize-winning situation comedies, first as psychologist Dr. Robert "Bob" Hartley on the 1970s sitcom <i>The Bob Newhart Show</i> and then as innkeeper Dick Loudon on the 1980s sitcom <i>Newhart</i>. He also had two short-lived sitcoms in the nineties titled <i>Bob</i> and <i>George and Leo</i>. Newhart also appeared in film roles such as Major Major in <i>Catch-22</i> and Papa Elf in <i>Elf</i>. He provided the voice of Bernard in the Walt Disney animated films <i>The Rescuers</i> and <i>The Rescuers Down Under</i>. In 2004 he played the library head Judson in <i>The Librarian</i> and again in 2006 and 2008. In 2011, Newhart made a cameo in the film <i>Horrible Bosses</i>, and in 2013 he guest starred in three episodes of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, for one of which he won his first Primetime Emmy Award on September 15, 2013.</p>

The liposome can be used as a vehicle for administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical drugs. Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes (such as by sonication).</p>
<p>Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed lipid chains with surfactant properties such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine. A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to unhealthy tissue.</p>
<p>The major types of liposomes are the multilamellar vesicle (MLV), the small unilamellar vesicle (SUV), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle.</p>
<p>Liposomes should not be confused with micelles and reverse micelles composed of monolayers.</p>
