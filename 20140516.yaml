  title: Narendra Modi
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Narendra Damodardas Modi</b> ( pronunciation , born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician who is the Prime Minister designate of India, after leading the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a decisive victory in the 2014 Indian general elections. He is a member of the Lok Sabha, representing the constituency of Varanasi. Modi is also the 14th and current Chief Minister of Gujarat, though he is expected to resign soon to take up to the office of Prime Minister.</p>
    <p>Modi was a key strategist for the BJP in the successful 1995 and 1998 Gujarat state election campaigns, and was a major campaign figure in the 2009 general elections, eventually won by the Indian National Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA). He first became chief minister of Gujarat in October 2001 after the resignation of his predecessor, Keshubhai Patel, and following the defeat of BJP in the by-elections. In July 2007, he became the longest-serving Chief Minister in Gujarat's history, at which point he had been in power for 2,063 days continuously. He is currently serving his fourth consecutive term as Chief Minister.</p>
    <p>Modi is a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and is described as a Hindu nationalist by media, scholars and himself. He is a controversial figure both within India and internationally as his administration has been criticised for the incidents surrounding the 2002 Gujarat riots. He has been praised for his economic policies, which are credited with creating an environment for a high rate of economic growth in Gujarat. However, his administration has also been criticised for failing to make a significant positive impact upon the human development of the state.</p>

  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>National Democratic Alliance</b> (<b>NDA</b>) is a centre-right coalition of political parties in India. At the time of its formation in 1998, it was led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and had thirteen constituent parties. Its current convener is N. Chandrababu Naidu and honorary chairman is former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Also representing the alliance are L. K. Advani, former deputy prime minister who is the acting chairman of the Alliance; Sushma Swaraj, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha; Arun Jaitley, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha; and Karia Munda, the Deputy Speaker in the Lok Sabha. The coalition was in power from 1998 to 2004. From 2004 to 2014, for a period of 10 years, it found itself difficult in its expansion. However, defying what many psephologists predicted, the alliance stormed back to power in the elections held in April/May 2014. Its leader, Narendra Modi is the soon-to-be-sworn-in Prime Minister of India.</p>

  title: Apostasy
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Apostasy</b> (/əˈpɒstəsi/; Greek: ἀποστασία (<i>apostasia</i>), 'a defection or revolt') is the formal disaffiliation from or abandonment or renunciation of a religion by a person. One who commits apostasy (or who <b>apostatizes</b>) is known as an <b>apostate</b>. The term <i>apostasy</i> is used by sociologists to mean renunciation <i>and</i> criticism of, or opposition to, a person's former religion, in a technical sense and without pejorative connotation.</p>
    <p>The term is occasionally also used metaphorically to refer to renunciation of a non-religious belief or cause, such as a political party, brain trust, or a sports team.</p>
    <p>Apostasy is generally not a self-definition: very few former believers call themselves apostates because of the pejorative implications of the term.</p>
    <p>Many religious groups and some states punish apostates. Apostates may be shunned by the members of their former religious group or subjected to formal or informal punishment. This may be the official policy of the religious group or may simply be the voluntary action of its members. Certain churches may in certain circumstances excommunicate the apostate, while some religious scriptures demand the death penalty for apostates.</p>

    <p><b>Godzilla</b> (ゴジラ, <i>Gojira</i><sup class="t_nihongo_help noprint">?</sup>) (/ɡɒdˈzɪlə/; [ɡoꜜdʑiɽa]<small class="nowrap"> ( )</small>) is a giant monster or daikaiju originating from a series of tokusatsu films of the same name from Japan. He first appeared in Ishirō Honda's 1954 film <i>Godzilla</i>. Since then, Godzilla has gone on to become a worldwide pop culture icon starring in 28 films produced by Toho Co., Ltd.. The character has appeared in numerous other medium incarnations including video games, novels, comic books, and television series. A 1998 American reimagining was produced by Tri-Star Pictures (the title monster of which was renamed to Zilla by Toho in 2004's <i>Godzilla: Final Wars</i>), while a second American version by Legendary Pictures was released on May 16, 2014. The character is commonly alluded to by the title <b>King of the Monsters</b>, an epithet first used in the Americanized version of Ishiro Honda's original 1954 film.</p>
    <p>With the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the <i>Lucky Dragon 5</i> incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for nuclear weapons. As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones portraying Godzilla as a hero while other plots still portrayed Godzilla as a destructive monster; sometimes the lesser of two threats who plays the defender by default but is still a danger to humanity.</p>

  extract: |-
    <p>In mathematics, the <b>witch of Agnesi</b> (<small>Italian pronunciation: </small>[aɲ.ˈɲe.si, -ɛ.zi]), sometimes called the <b>witch of Maria Agnesi</b> is the curve defined as follows.</p>

    <p>Starting with a fixed circle, a point O on the circle is chosen. For any other point A on the circle, the secant line OA is drawn. The point M is diametrically opposite to O. The line OA intersects the tangent of M at the point N. The line parallel to OM through N, and the line perpendicular to OM through A intersect at P. As the point A is varied, the path of P is the witch.</p>
    <p>The curve is asymptotic to the line tangent to the fixed circle through the point O.</p>
