  extract: |-
    <p>A <b>mother</b> (or <b>mum</b>/<b>mom/mam</b>) is a woman who has raised a child, given birth to a child, and/or supplied the egg which in union with a sperm grew into a child. The definition can also be extended to non-human animals and may then also include being the animal that donated a body cell which has resulted in a clone. Because of the complexity and differences of a mother's social, cultural, and religious definitions and roles, it is challenging to specify a universally acceptable definition for the term.</p>
    <p>The male parallel is father.</p>

They recorded with the producers of The Tokens, releasing the single "Denise" in 1963. The song hit #18 on the US Black Singles chart and #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 that year. "Denise" was written by Neil Levenson, and was inspired by his childhood friend, Denice Lefrak. The song later became a European hit for Blondie, with the title changed to "Denis". Randy &amp; The Rainbows' follow-up single, "Why Do Kids Grow Up", barely scraped the pop charts at #97, and the group never charted again.</p>

  title: Sports in the United States
  extract: |-
    <p>Sports are an important part of the culture of the United States. Three of the nation's five most popular team sports were developed in North America: American football, basketball and ice hockey, whereas soccer was developed in England and baseball was developed in both Ireland and the United States. The four major professional sports leagues in the United States are Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), and the National Hockey League (NHL); all enjoy massive media exposure and are considered the preeminent competitions in their respective sports in the world. Three of those leagues have teams that represent Canadian cities, and all four are among the most lucrative sports leagues in the world. The top professional soccer league in the United States, Major League Soccer, has not yet reached the popularity levels of the top four sports leagues, although average attendance has been increasing and in fact has surpassed those of the NBA and the NHL.</p>
    <p>Professional teams in all major sports operate as franchises within a league. All major sports leagues use the same type of schedule with a playoff tournament after the regular season ends. In addition to the major league-level organizations, several sports also have professional minor leagues, active in smaller cities across the country.</p>
    <p>Sports are particularly associated with education in the United States, with most high schools and universities having organized sports. College sports competitions play an important role in the American sporting culture. In many cases college athletics are more popular than professional sports, with the major sanctioning body being the NCAA.</p>

  title: Everybody's Somebody's Fool
  extract: |-
    <p>"<b>Everybody's Somebody's Fool</b>" is a song written by Jack Keller (music) and Howard Greenfield (lyrics) that was a #1 hit for Connie Francis in mid 1960.</p>
    <p>Although "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" was written as a bluesy ballad, Francis envisioned the song as polka-style number feeling that as such it would fare well in the West German market. Producer Arnold Maxin followed Francis's advisement in the 7 April 1960 session at Olmstead Studios (NYC) when Francis cut the song with the Joe Sherman Orchestra.</p>
    <p>In the US, "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" was intended to serve as the B-side for the track "Jealous of You (Tango Della Gelosia)", which like Francis's precedent A-side hit "Mama" was a ballad of Italian origin. However, most American radio stations preferred to play "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" and, while "Jealous of You" did reach #19, "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" reached #1 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 on 27 June 1960 and remained there the following week. The first of Francis's three US #1's, "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" was also ranked on the R&amp;B chart at #2 and was the only one of Francis's major hits to cross over to the C&amp;W charts where it peaked at #24.</p>
    <p>A #5 hit in the UK, "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" was #1 in Australia for three weeks in July 1960 and in South Africa ranked as the #15 hit for that year.[1]</p>
    <p>Francis's instincts re the West German hit potential of "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" proved correct: rendered as "Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel" became the best-selling single of 1960 in West Germany where the original English version of the song also reached #25 in West Germany. "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" was also #1 in Norway for eight weeks. Translated versions of the song include those made by Celly Campello (pt) (in Portuguese as "Alguém é bobo de alguém"), Marketta Joutsi and also Sinikka Lehtevä (in Finnish as "Pajunköyttä") and Siw Malmkvist (in Swedish as "Tunna skivor"). Subsequent to "Everybody's Somebody's Fool", Francis herself began to cut versions of all her single releases in several different languages.</p>
    <p>"Everybody's Somebody's Fool" was remade in 1979 by Debby Boone who had previously had Top 20 C&amp;W hits with her Connie Francis hit remakes "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" and "Breakin' in a Brand New Broken Heart"; however, Boone's version of "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" only reached #48 C&amp;W. The song has also been an album cut for Lynn Anderson, Pat Boone, Ann Breen, Sierra Hull, Margo, Jody Miller, Marie Osmond, Sandy Posey, Billy Vaughn, Kitty Wells and Bobby Vee.</p>
    <p>The song originally recorded by Connie Francis entitled "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" is often confused with an earlier song of the same title written by Ace Adams and Lionel Hampton which has been recorded by LaVern Baker, Red Garland, Michael Jackson, Etta James, the Heartbeats (#78/ 1957), Clyde McPhatter, Arthur Prysock, Little Jimmy Scott, Kay Starr, Dakota Staton, and Dinah Washington.</p>
    <p>The arrangement performed by Connie Francis is noted for its organ introduction.</p>
