It is bounded by Asia—including India, after which the ocean is named—on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, by Antarctica).</p>
<p>As one component of the World Ocean, the Indian Ocean is delineated from the Atlantic Ocean by the 20° east meridian running south from Cape Agulhas, and from the Pacific Ocean by the meridian of 146°55' east. The northernmost extent of the Indian Ocean is approximately 30° north in the Persian Gulf. The ocean is nearly 10,000 km (6200 mi) wide at the southern tips of Africa and Australia, and its area is 73,556,000 km² (28,350,000 mi²), including the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean's volume is estimated to be 292,131,000 km³ (70,086,000 mi³). Small islands dot the continental rims. Island nations within the ocean are Madagascar (the world's fourth largest island), Bahrain, Comoros, Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles and Sri Lanka. The archipelago of Indonesia and the island nation of Timor-Leste border the ocean on the east.</p>

Upon suspension of Russia on March 24, 2014 due to the Crimea crisis, the existence of the G8 designation has now been merged with that of the G7 group of nations.</p>
<p>The forum originated with a 1975 summit hosted by France that brought together representatives of six governments: France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, thus leading to the name <b>Group of Six</b> or <b>G6</b>. The summit became known as the <b>Group of Seven</b> or <b>G7</b> the following year with the addition of Canada. The G7 is composed of the seven wealthiest developed countries on Earth (by national net wealth or by GDP), and it remained active even during the period of the G8. Russia was added to the group from 1998 to 2014, which then became known as the G8. The European Union is represented within the G8 but could not host or chair summits.</p>
<p>"G8" can refer to the member states in aggregate or to the annual summit meeting of the G8 heads of government. The former term, G6, is now frequently applied to the six most populous countries within the European Union. G8 ministers also meet throughout the year, such as the G7/8 finance ministers (who meet four times a year), G8 foreign ministers, or G8 environment ministers.</p>
<p>Collectively, in 2012 the G8 nations comprised 50.1% of 2012 global nominal GDP and 40.9% of global GDP (PPP). Each calendar year the responsibility of hosting the G8 is rotated through the member states in the following order: France, United States, United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada. The holder of the presidency sets the agenda, hosts the summit for that year, and determines which ministerial meetings will take place. Both France and the United Kingdom have expressed a desire to expand the group to include five developing countries, referred to as the <b>Outreach Five</b> (O5) or the Plus Five: Brazil (7th country in the world by nominal GDP ), People's Republic of China (2nd country in the world by GDP ), India (10th country in the world by GDP ), Mexico, and South Africa. These countries have participated as guests in meetings which are sometimes called G8+5.</p>
<p>With the G-20 major economies growing in stature since the 2008 Washington summit, world leaders from the group announced at their Pittsburgh summit on September 25, 2009, that the group would replace the G8 as the main economic council of wealthy nations.</p>
<p>On March 24th 2014, the original G7 nations voted to effectively suspend Russia from the organization in response to the country's annexation of Crimea; however, it was made clear that the suspension was temporary.</p>

<p>With a diameter of 396 kilometres (246 mi) it is the twentieth-largest moon in the Solar System and is the smallest astronomical body that is known to be rounded in shape because of self-gravitation.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimas_(moon)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Helios Airways Flight 522</h2><p><b>Helios Airways Flight 522</b> was a scheduled Helios Airways passenger flight that crashed into a mountain on 14 August 2005 at 12:04 pm EEST, north of Marathon and Varnavas, Greece, whilst flying from Larnaca, Cyprus to Athens, Greece. A lack of oxygen incapacitated the crew, leading to the aircraft's eventual crash after running out of fuel. Rescue teams located the wreckage near the community of Grammatiko, 40 km (25 mi) from Athens. All 115 passengers and 6 crew on board the aircraft were killed.</p>
<p>With 121 fatalities, this was the deadliest aviation disaster in Greek history. Flight 522's loss marked the 69th crash of a Boeing 737 (the most widely-used passenger jet aircraft in the world) since it was brought into service in 1968. The crash is the fourth-deadliest involving a 737-300.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_Airways_Flight_522' >More...</a><hr><h2> Oderus Urungus</h2><p><b>Oderus Urungus</b> was the lead vocalist of the metal band Gwar. The character appeared as an intergalactic humanoid barbarian with devil horns and a meaty-looking face, and always carried around a long sword named "Unt Lick". His only true companion was his cuttlefish, though lost for a short period it has returned to its true resting place, strategically placed over his loins.</p>
<p>Urungus was portrayed from the band's beginnings by Canadian-American musician <b>David Murray "Dave" Brockie</b> (August 30, 1963 – March 23, 2014), who outside of Gwar also performed as a bassist and lead singer of several side projects, including X-Cops and the Dave Brockie Experience. Brockie died March 23, 2014, leaving the character's (and the band's) future unknown.</p>

<p>According to historian T. Dunbar Moodie, Afrikaner nationalism could be described as a kind of civil religion that combined the history of the Afrikaners, their language and the Afrikaner Calvinism as key symbols. A major proponent of the ideology was the secret <i>Broederbond</i> organisation and the National Party that ruled the country from 1948 to 1994. Other organisations aligned with the Afrikaner nationalist ideology were the Federation of Afrikaans Cultural Organisations (<i>Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge</i> , FAK), the Institute for Christian National Education and the White Workers' Protection Association.</p>
