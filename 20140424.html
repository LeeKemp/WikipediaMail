		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 24 April 2014 </h1><h2> QuantiFERON</h2><p><b>Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs)</b> are diagnostic tools for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). They are surrogate markers of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection and indicate a cellular immune response to <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. IGRAs cannot distinguish between latent infection and active tuberculosis (TB) disease, and should not be used as a sole method for diagnosis of active TB, which is a microbiological diagnosis. A positive IGRA result may not necessarily indicate active TB, however a negative IGRA result rules out the possibility of both active and latent tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Because IGRAs are not affected by Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination status, IGRAs are useful for evaluation of LTBI in BCG-vaccinated individuals, particularly in settings where BCG vaccination is administered after infancy or multiple (booster) BCG vaccinations are given. In contrast, the specificity of tuberculin skin test (TST) varies depending on timing of BCG and whether repeated (booster) vaccinations are given.</p>
<p><b>QuantiFERON</b>, also known as QFT, is the registered trademark of the test for tuberculosis infection or latent tuberculosis. QFT is an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) used in tuberculosis diagnosis. The QFT-GIT assay is an ELISA-based, whole-blood test that uses peptides from three TB antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10, and TB7.7) in an in-tube format. The result is reported as quantification of IFN-gamma in international units (IU) per mL. An individual is considered positive for <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection if the IFN-gamma response to TB antigens is above the test cut-off (after subtracting the background IFN-gamma response in the negative control).</p>

The wood is rapidly decomposed by applying heat and pressure in a closed container; the primary resulting products are charcoal and pine tar.</p>
<p>Pine tar consists primarily of aromatic hydrocarbons, tar acids and tar bases. Components of tar vary according to the pyrolytic process (e.g. method, duration, temperature) and origin of the wood (e.g. age of pine trees, type of soil and moisture conditions during tree growth). The choice of wood, design of kiln, burning and collection of the tar can vary. Only pine stumps and roots are used in the traditional production of pine tar.</p>
<p>Pine tar has a long history as a wood preservative, as a wood sealant for maritime use, in roofing construction and maintenance, in soaps such as Packer’s Pine Tar Soap and in the treatment of carbuncles and skin diseases, such as psoriasis, eczema, and rosacea.</p>

As of the 2007 census, it has a population of 1,373,382 in the city proper, and about 2 million in total when including the suburbs located in the Pool Region. The populous city of Kinshasa (more than 10 million inhabitants in 2009), capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, lies just across the Congo River from Brazzaville. Together with Kinshasa, the combined conurbation of Kinshasa-Brazzaville has thus nearly 12 million inhabitants (although significant political and infrastructure challenges prevent the two cities from functioning with any meaningful connection). Over a third of the population of the Republic of Congo lives in the capital, and it is home to 40% of non-agricultural employment. It is also a financial and administrative capital.</p>

Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by family name or pseudonym. Deaths of notable animals and other organisms are also reported here if they first have their own article. A typical entry reports information in the following sequence:</p>
<ul><li>Name, age, country of citizenship and reason for notability, established cause of death, reference.</li>

Breaching experiments are most commonly associated with ethnomethodology, and in particular the work of Harold Garfinkel. Breaching experiments involve the conscious exhibition of “unexpected” behavior/violation of social norms, an observation of the types of social reactions such behavioral violations engender, and an analysis of the social structure that makes these social reactions possible. The idea of studying the violation of social norms and the accompanying reactions has bridged across social science disciplines, and is today used in both sociology and psychology.</p>
<p>The assumption behind this approach is not only that individuals engage daily in building up "rules" for social interaction, but also that people are unaware they are doing so. The work of sociologist Erving Goffman laid the theoretical foundation for ways to study the construction of everyday social meanings and behavioral norms, especially by breaking unstated but universally accepted rules. Garfinkel expanded on this idea by developing ethnomethodology as a qualitative research method for social scientists. Later, in the 1970s and 80s, famous social psychologist, Stanley Milgram, developed two experiments which enabled observations of responses to breaches in social norms to be quantified in order to empirically analyze people's reactions to the violation of social norms.</p>
