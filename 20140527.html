		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 27 May 2014 </h1><h2> Postpartum depression</h2><p><b>Postpartum depression</b> (<b>PPD</b>), also called <b>postnatal depression</b>, is a type of clinical depression which can affect women, and less frequently men, typically after childbirth. Studies report prevalence rates among women from 5% to 25%, but methodological differences among the studies make the actual prevalence rate unclear. Among men, in particular new fathers, the incidence of postpartum depression has been estimated to be between 1% and 25.5%. Symptoms include sadness, fatigue, changes in sleeping and eating patterns, reduced libido, crying episodes, anxiety, and irritability. Although a number of risk factors have been identified, the causes of PPD are not well understood. Many women recover with a treatment consisting of a support group or counseling.</p>
<p>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, a standardized self-reported questionnaire, may be used to identify women who have postpartum depression. If the new mother scores 13 or more, she is likely be suffering from PPD and further assessment should follow.</p>

<p>Carson began her career as an aquatic biologist in the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, and became a full-time nature writer in the 1950s. Her widely praised 1951 bestseller <i>The Sea Around Us</i> won her a U.S. National Book Award, recognition as a gifted writer, and financial security. Her next book, <i>The Edge of the Sea</i>, and the reissued version of her first book, <i>Under the Sea Wind</i>, were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths.</p>
<p>Late in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially environmental problems that she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was <i>Silent Spring</i> (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although <i>Silent Spring</i> was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides, and it inspired a grassroots environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter.</p>

It was released on 27 May 2014 for Microsoft Windows, the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, with a Wii U version planned for release in the fourth quarter of 2014.
