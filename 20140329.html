The terms <i>introversion</i> and <i>extraversion</i> were first popularized by Carl Jung, although both the popular understanding and psychological age differ from his original intent. Extraversion tends to be manifested in outgoing, talkative, energetic behavior, whereas introversion is manifested in more reserved and solitary behavior. Virtually all comprehensive models of personality include these concepts in various forms. Examples include the Big Five model, Jung's analytical psychology, Hans Eysenck's three-factor model, Raymond Cattell's 16 personality factors, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator.</p>
<p>Extroversion and introversion are typically viewed as a single continuum. Thus, to be high on one it is necessary to be low on the other. Carl Jung and the authors of the Myers–Briggs provide a different perspective and suggest that everyone has both an extraverted side and an introverted side, with one being more dominant than the other. Rather than focusing on interpersonal behavior, however, Jung defined introversion as an "attitude-type characterised by orientation in life through subjective psychic contents" (focus on one's inner psychic activity); and extraversion as "an attitude type characterised by concentration of interest on the external object", (the outside world).</p>
<p>In any case, people fluctuate in their behavior all the time, and even extreme introverts and extroverts do not always act according to their type.</p>

The word "jackalope" is a portmanteau of "jackrabbit" and "antelope". A group of jackalopes is called a flaggerdoot.</p>
<p>The story of the jackalope was popularised in Wyoming in the 1930s after a local hunter used taxidermy skills to graft deer antlers onto a jackrabbit carcass, selling the creature to a local hotel. It is possible that the tales of jackalopes were inspired by sightings of rabbits infected with the <i>Shope papilloma virus</i>, which causes the growth of horn- and antler-like tumors in various places on the rabbit's head and body. However, the concept of an animal hybrid occurs in many cultures, for example as the griffin and the chimera.</p>

It was suspected that he was falsely charged, however, and he was never executed as a result. On March 10, 2011, Guinness World Records certified Hakamada as the world’s longest-held death row inmate. In March 2014 he was granted a retrial and an immediate release when the Shizuoka District Court found there was reason to believe evidence against him had been falsified.</p>

It is characterized by abnormal transport of chloride and sodium across an epithelium, leading to thick, viscous secretions.</p>
<p>The name <i>cystic fibrosis</i> refers to the characteristic scarring (fibrosis) and cyst formation within the pancreas, first recognized in the 1930s. Difficulty breathing is the most serious symptom and results from frequent lung infections that are treated with antibiotics and other medications. Other symptoms—including sinus infections, poor growth, and infertility—affect other parts of the body.</p>
<p>CF is caused by a frameshift mutation in the gene  for the protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This protein is required to regulate the components of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. CFTR regulates the movement of chloride and sodium ions across epithelial membranes, such as the alveolar epithelia located in the lungs. Most people without CF have two working copies of the CFTR gene, and both copies must be missing for CF to develop, due to the disorder's recessive nature. CF develops when neither copy works normally (as a result of mutation) and therefore has autosomal recessive inheritance.</p>
<p>CF is most common among people of Central and Northern European ancestry, but occurs in many demographic groups around the world. The prevalence of CF is the rarest in Asia and the Middle East. Individuals with cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed before birth by genetic testing, or by a sweat test in early childhood. Ultimately, lung transplantation is often necessary as CF worsens.</p>

A mutation of the body's repair mechanism causes fibrous tissue (including muscle, tendon, and ligament) to be ossified spontaneously or when damaged. In many cases, injuries can cause joints to become permanently frozen in place. Surgical removal of the extra bone growths has been shown to cause the body to "repair" the affected area with more bone.</p>
