		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 01 November 2013 </h1><h2> Orthopedic surgery</h2><p><b>Orthopedic surgery</b> or <b>orthopedics</b> (also spelled <b>orthopaedic surgery</b> and <b>orthopaedics</b>) is the branch of surgery concerned with conditions involving the musculoskeletal system. Orthopedic surgeons use both surgical and nonsurgical means to treat musculoskeletal trauma, sports injuries, degenerative diseases, infections, tumors, and congenital disorders.</p>
<p>Nicholas Andry coined the word "<i>orthopaedics</i>" in French as <i>orthopédie</i>, derived from the Greek words <i>orthos</i> ("correct", "straight") and <i>paidion</i> ("child"), when he published <i>Orthopedie</i> (translated as <i>Orthopaedia: or the Art of Correcting and Preventing Deformities in Children</i>) in 1741. The correction of spinal and bony deformities became the cornerstone of orthopedic practice.</p>
<p>In the US the majority of college, university and residency programs, and even the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, still use the spelling with the Latinate digraph ae. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are acceptable; <i>orthopaedics</i> usually prevails in the rest of the British Commonwealth, especially in the UK.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery' >More...</a><hr><h2> Fire hydrant</h2><p>A <i>fire hydrant</i> is an active fire protection measure, and a source of water provided in most urban, suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire. Buildings near a hydrant may qualify for an insurance discount since firefighters should be able to more rapidly extinguish a fire on the insured property.</p>
<p>The concept of <i>fire plugs</i> dates to at least the 17th century. This was a time when firefighters responding to a call would dig down to the wooden water mains and hastily bore a hole to secure water to fight fires. The water would fill the hole creating a temporary well, and be transported from the well to the fire by bucket brigades or, later, by hand-pumped fire engines. The holes were then plugged with stoppers, normally redwood, which over time came to be known as <i>fire plugs</i>. The location of the plug would often be recorded or marked so that it could be reused in future fires. This is the source of the colloquial term <i>fire plug</i> still used for fire hydrants today. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, the city installed water mains with holes drilled at intervals, equipped with risers, allowing an access point to the wooden fire plugs from street level.</p>
<p>The invention of a post- or pillar-type fire hydrant is generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr., Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801. It had a combination hose/faucet outlet and was of "wet barrel" design with the valve in the top. It is said that Graff held the first patent for a fire hydrant, but this cannot be verified because the patent office in Washington D.C. caught on fire in 1836 destroying many patent records from that period in the process.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_hydrant' >More...</a><hr><h2> All Saints' Day</h2><p><b>All Saints' Day</b> (also known as <b>All Hallows</b>, <b>Solemnity of All Saints</b>, or <b>The Feast of All Saints</b>) is a solemnity celebrated on 1 November by parts of Western Christianity, and on the first Sunday after Pentecost in Eastern Christianity, in honour of all the saints, known and unknown. All Saints' Day is the second day of Hallowmas, and begins at sunrise on the first day of November and finishes at sundown. It is the day before All Souls' Day.</p>
<p>In Western Christian theology, the day commemorates all those who have attained the beatific vision in Heaven. It is a national holiday in many historically Catholic countries. In the Catholic Church and many Anglican churches, the next day specifically commemorates the departed faithful who have not yet been purified and reached heaven. Christians who celebrate All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day do so in the fundamental belief that there is a prayerful spiritual bond between those in heaven (the 'Church triumphant'), and the living (the 'Church militant'). Other Christian traditions define, remember and respond to the saints in different ways; for example, in the Methodist Church, the word "saints" refers to all Christians and therefore, on All Saints' Day, the Church Universal, as well as the deceased members of a local congregation, are honored and remembered.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints%27_Day' >More...</a><hr><h2> Israel</h2><p>Coordinates: 31°N 35°E﻿ / 31; 35</p>
<p><b>Israel</b> /ˈɪzreɪəl/, officially the <b>State of Israel</b> (Hebrew: מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל‎, <i>Medīnat Yisrā'el</i>, <small>IPA: </small>[mediˈnat jisʁaˈʔel]<small class="nowrap"> ( listen)</small>; Arabic: دولة إِسرائيل‎, <i>Dawlat Isrāʼīl</i>, <small>IPA: </small>[dawlat ʔisraːˈʔiːl]), is a country in Western Asia, on the south-eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. It shares land borders with Lebanon in the north, Syria in the northeast, Jordan and Palestine in the east, Egypt and the Gaza Strip on the southwest, and the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea to the south, and it contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. In its Basic Laws Israel defines itself as a Jewish and Democratic State; it is the world's only Jewish-majority state.</p>
<p>On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly recommended the adoption and implementation of the partition plan of Mandatory Palestine. On 14 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion, the Executive Head of the World Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared "the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel," a state independent upon the termination of the British Mandate for Palestine, 15 May 1948. Neighboring Arab armies invaded Palestine on the next day and fought the Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai Peninsula (between 1967 and 1982), part of South Lebanon (between 1982 and 2000), Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. It annexed portions of these territories, including East Jerusalem, but the border with the West Bank is disputed. Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, but efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have so far not resulted in peace.</p>
<p>Israel's financial center is Tel Aviv, while Jerusalem (if East Jerusalem is included) is the country's most populous city and its designated capital. The population of Israel, as defined by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, was estimated in 2013 to be 8,051,200 people, of whom 6,045,900 are Jewish. Arabs form the country's second-largest group with 1,663,400 people (including the Druze and most East Jerusalem Arabs). The great majority of Israeli Arabs are settled-Muslims, with smaller but significant numbers of semi-settled Negev Bedouins; the rest are Christians and Druze. Other minorities than Arabs include 300,000 Russian-descendants who are not considered Jewish according to rabbinical law but were eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return, and make up another 3% of the Israeli population, as well as some Maronites, Samaritans, Black Hebrew Israelites, Armenians, Circassians and others. Israel also hosts a significant population of non-citizen foreign workers and asylum seekers from Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system, proportional representation and universal suffrage. The Prime Minister serves as head of government and the Knesset serves as Israel's unicameral legislative body. Israel has one of the highest life expectancies in the world. It is a developed country, an OECD member, and its economy, based on the nominal gross domestic product, was the 43rd-largest in the world in 2012. Israel has the highest standard of living in the Middle East and the third highest in Asia.</p>

It declared the Metric system "the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce", but permitted the use of United States customary units in non-business activities. The Act also established the United States Metric Board with representatives from scientific, technical, and educational institutions, as well as state and local governments to plan, coordinate, and educate the American people for the Metrication of the United States.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_Conversion_Act' >More...</a><hr><h2> River Phoenix</h2><p><b>River Jude Phoenix</b> (August 23, 1970 – October 31, 1993) was an American film actor, musician, and activist. He was the older brother of Rain Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Summer Phoenix and Liberty Phoenix. Phoenix's work encompassed 24 films and television appearances, including the science fiction adventure film <i>Explorers</i>, the coming-of-age film <i>Stand by Me</i>, the action sequel <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i> and the independent adult drama <i>My Own Private Idaho</i>. Phoenix's meteoric rise to fame led to his status as a "teen sensation".</p>
<p>Phoenix began acting at age 10 in television commercials. He appeared in diverse roles, making his first notable appearance in the 1986 film <i>Stand by Me</i>, a hugely popular coming-of-age film based on a novella by Stephen King. Phoenix made a transition into more adult-oriented roles with <i>Running on Empty</i> (1988), playing the son of fugitive parents in a well-received performance that earned him a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and <i>My Own Private Idaho</i> (1991), playing a gay hustler in search of his estranged mother. For his performance in the latter, Phoenix garnered enormous praise and won a Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival, along with Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics.</p>
<p>On October 31, 1993, Phoenix collapsed and died of drug-induced heart failure on the sidewalk outside the West Hollywood nightclub The Viper Room. At the time of his death, Phoenix had been in the middle of filming <i>Dark Blood</i> (1993).</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Phoenix' >More...</a><hr><h2> Rebekah Brooks</h2><p><b>Rebekah Mary Brooks</b> (née <b>Wade</b>; born 27 May 1968) is a British journalist and former newspaper editor. She was chief executive officer of News International from 2009 to 2011, having previously served as the youngest editor of a British national newspaper at <i>News of the World</i> from 2000 to 2003, and the first female editor of <i>The Sun</i> from 2003 to 2009. Brooks married actor Ross Kemp in 2002. They divorced in 2009 and she married former racehorse trainer and author Charlie Brooks.</p>
<p>Brooks is a prominent figure in the News International phone hacking scandal, having been the editor of the <i>News of the World</i> when illegal phone hacking was carried out by the newspaper. On 15 July 2011, Brooks resigned as chief executive of News International, following widespread criticism of her role in the controversy. On 17 July 2011, she was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and on suspicion of corruption – making corrupt payments to public officials. On 13 March 2012, she was again arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. On 15 May 2012, Brooks was charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Brooks said she was "baffled" by the decision to charge her.</p>
<p>Brooks and her husband appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court on 13 June on charges linked to the phone hacking scandal. District Judge Howard Riddle told the defendants they would go on trial at a later date at Southwark Crown Court remanding Brooks and her husband on bail until the next hearing on 22 June.</p>
<p>On 24 July 2012, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that Brooks would be charged, along with six other former members of the staff of the <i>News of the World</i>, with conspiring to intercept communications without lawful authority, from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006. In addition to this "generic" charge, Brooks would be charged with four specific counts of conspiracy to intercept communications without lawful authority. These include a charge relating to the hacking of the voicemail of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekah_Brooks' >More...</a><hr><h2> Ender's Game</h2><p><i><b>Ender's Game</b></i> (1985) is a military science fiction novel by American author Orson Scott Card. Set in Earth's future, the novel presents an imperilled mankind after two conflicts with the "Buggers", an insectoid alien species. In preparation for an anticipated third invasion, children, including the novel's protagonist, Ender Wiggin, are trained at a very young age through increasingly difficult games including some in zero gravity, where Ender's tactical genius is revealed.</p>
<p>The book originated as the short story "Ender's Game", published in the August 1977 issue of <i>Analog Science Fiction and Fact</i>. Elaborating on characters and plot lines depicted in the novel, Card later wrote additional books to form the Ender's Game series. Card released an updated version of <i>Ender's Game</i> in 1991, changing some political facts to accurately reflect the times; most notably, to include the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Reception of the book has generally been positive, though some critics have denounced Card's perceived justification of his characters' violences. It has also become suggested reading for many military organizations, including the United States Marine Corps. <i>Ender's Game</i> won the 1985 Nebula Award for best novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for best novel. Its sequels, <i>Speaker for the Dead</i>, <i>Xenocide</i>, <i>Children of the Mind</i> and <i>Ender in Exile</i>, follow Ender's subsequent travels to many different worlds in the galaxy. In addition, the later novella <i>A War of Gifts</i> and novel <i>Ender's Shadow</i> take place during the same time period as the original. <i>Ender's Game</i> has been adapted into two comic series.</p>
<p>A film adaptation of the same name directed by Gavin Hood and starring Asa Butterfield as Ender was released in October 2013. Card co-produced the film.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game' >More...</a><hr><h2> Parental leave</h2><p><b>Parental leave</b> is an employee benefit that provides paid or unpaid time off work to care for a child or make arrangements for the child's welfare. The term "parental leave" includes maternity, paternity, and adoption leave. Often, the minimum benefits are stipulated by law.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave' >More...</a><hr><h2> Global warming</h2><p><b>Global warming</b> is the rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation. Since the early 20th century, Earth's mean surface temperature has increased by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F), with about two-thirds of the increase occurring since 1980. Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and scientists are 95-100% certain that it is primarily caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These findings are recognized by the national science academies of all major industrialized nations.</p>
<p>Climate model projections were summarized in the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 1.1 to 2.9 °C (2 to 5.2 °F change) for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.4 to 6.4 °C (4.3 to 11.5 °F change) for their highest. The ranges of these estimates arise from the use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations.</p>
<p>Future climate change and associated impacts will vary from region to region around the globe. The effects of an increase in global temperature include a rise in sea levels and a change in the amount and pattern of precipitation, as well as a probable expansion of subtropical deserts. Warming is expected to be strongest in the Arctic and would be associated with the continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost and sea ice. Other likely effects of the warming include a more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events including heat waves, droughts and heavy rainfall, ocean acidification and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes. Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the loss of habitat from inundation.</p>
<p>Proposed policy responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction, adaptation to its effects, and possible future geoengineering. Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) climate change. Parties to the UNFCCC have adopted a range of policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to assist in adaptation to global warming. Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required, and that future global warming should be limited to below 2.0 °C (3.6 °F) relative to the pre-industrial level. Reports published in 2011 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Energy Agency suggest that efforts as of the early 21st century to reduce emissions may be inadequate to meet the UNFCCC's 2 °C target.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming' >More...</a><hr><h2> Dhanteras</h2><p><b>Dhanteras</b> ( Hindi : धनतेरस, Sanskrit/Marathi : धनत्रयोदशी) is the first day of the five-day Diwali Festival as celebrated in India. The festival, known as <b>"Dhanatrayodashi"</b> or <b>"Dhanvantari Trayodashi"</b>.The word <b>Dhan</b> means wealth and <b>Teras</b> means 13th day as per Hindu calendar. It is celebrated on the thirteenth lunar day of Krishna paksha (dark fortnight) in the Hindu calendar month of Ashwin.</p>
<p>On Dhanteras, Goddess Lakshmi is worshiped to provide prosperity and well being. Dhanteras holds special significance for the business community due to the customary purchases of precious metals on this day.</p>
<p>Lord Kubera, the God of assets and wealth is also worshiped on this day. </p>

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhanteras' >More...</a><hr><h2> Greenhouse gas</h2><p>A <b>greenhouse gas</b> (sometimes abbreviated <b>GHG</b>) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars, and Titan also contain gases that cause greenhouse effects. Greenhouse gases greatly affect the temperature of the Earth; without them, Earth's surface would average about 33 C° (59 F°) colder than the present average of 14 °C (57 °F).</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (taken as the year 1750), the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to a 40% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, from 280 to 392.6 parts-per-million (ppm) in 2012. This increase has occurred despite the uptake of a large portion of the emissions by various natural "sinks" involved in the carbon cycle. Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions (i.e., emissions produced by human activities) come from combustion of carbon based fuels, principally wood, coal, oil, and natural gas.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-11-01 11:30:08 -0400 -->
