		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 20 May 2014 </h1><h2> Fern</h2><p>A <b>fern</b> is any one or more of a group of roughly 12,000 species of plants belonging to the botanical group known as Pteridophyta. Unlike mosses, they are vascular plants. They have stems and leaves, like other vascular plants. Ferns reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. Most ferns have what are called fiddleheads. The fiddleheads expand into what are called fronds, which are each delicately divided.</p>
<p>By far the largest group of ferns is the leptosporangiate ferns, but ferns as defined here (also called <b>monilophytes</b>) include horsetails, whisk ferns, marattioid ferns, and ophioglossoid ferns. The term <b>pteridophyte</b> traditionally refers to ferns and a few other seedless vascular plants (see classification section below), although some recent authors have used the term to refer strictly to the monilophytes.</p>
<p>Ferns first appear in the fossil record 360 million years ago in the late Devonian period but many of the current families and species did not appear until roughly 145 million years ago in the early Cretaceous, after flowering plants came to dominate many environments.</p>
<p>Ferns are not of major economic importance, but some are grown or gathered for food, as ornamental plants, for remediating contaminated soils, and have been the subject of research for their ability to remove some chemical pollutants from the air. Some are significant weeds. They also play a role in mythology, medicine, and art</p>

He was formerly manager of Ajax, Barcelona, AZ and Bayern Munich; on 19 May 2014, van Gaal was appointed as the manager of Manchester United on a three-year contract beginning from the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p>Before his career as a coach, Van Gaal played as a midfielder for Royal Antwerp, Telstar, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ. He is also a fully qualified gymnastics teacher and has worked as such at high schools during various stages of his career as a semi-professional footballer. Van Gaal is an avid proponent of attacking football, educated in the tradition of the <i>Total Football</i> playing style of Ajax and the Dutch national team of the 1970s.</p>
<p>After a brief spell as coach at AZ, Van Gaal served as assistant coach under Leo Beenhakker at Ajax and eventually took over as head coach in 1991. Under his lead, the club won three Eredivisie titles, the UEFA Cup, and the Champions League. Van Gaal moved to Barcelona in 1997 and won two Spanish league titles and one Copa del Rey. After some disagreements at Barcelona, he was appointed coach of the Netherlands national team, but failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. Another brief spell at Barcelona followed before he became manager of AZ. After winning the Eredivisie with AZ in 2008–09, he was hired by Bayern Munich on 1 July 2009. In his first season at Bayern, he secured the Bundesliga title, won the DFB-Pokal, and reached the final of the Champions League.
