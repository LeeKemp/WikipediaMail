		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 30 January 2014 </h1><h2> Silver Cross Tavern</h2><p>The <b>Silver Cross Tavern</b> is a pub on Whitehall in London, England. It was first opened as a licensed pub in 1674 after having previously been a brothel.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Cross_Tavern' >More...</a><hr><h2> Anxiety disorder</h2><p><b>Anxiety disorder</b> is an umbrella term that covers several different forms of a type of common mental disorder, characterized by excessive rumination, worrying, uneasiness, apprehension and fear about future uncertainties either based on real or imagined events, which may affect both physical and psychological health. There are numerous psychiatric and medical syndromes which may mimic the symptoms of an anxiety disorder such as hyperthyroidism which may be misdiagnosed as generalized anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>Individuals diagnosed with an anxiety disorder may be classified in one of two categories; based on whether they experience continuous or episodic symptoms.</p>
<p>Current psychiatric diagnostic criteria recognize a wide variety of anxiety disorders. Recent surveys have shown that as many as 18% of Americans and 14% of Europeans may be affected by one or more of them.</p>
<p>The term anxiety covers four aspects of experiences that an individual may have: mental apprehension, physical tension, physical symptoms and dissociative anxiety. Anxiety disorder is divided into generalized anxiety disorder, phobic disorder, and panic disorder; each has its own characteristics and symptoms and they require different treatment (Gelder <i>et al.</i> 2005). The emotions present in anxiety disorders range from simple nervousness to bouts of terror (Barker 2003).</p>
<p>Standardized screening clinical questionnaires such as the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale or the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale can be used to detect anxiety symptoms, and suggest the need for a formal diagnostic assessment of anxiety disorder.</p>

In July 2012, the European Medicines Agency recommended it for approval, the first recommendation for a gene therapy treatment in either Europe or the United States. The recommendation was endorsed by the European Commission in November 2012 and commercial rollout is expected in late 2013.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alipogene_tiparvovec' >More...</a><hr><h2> Chinese New Year</h2><p><b>Chinese New Year</b> is an important traditional Chinese holiday celebrated at the turn of the Chinese calendar. In China, it is also known as the <b>Spring Festival</b>, the literal translation of the modern Chinese name. Chinese New Year celebrations traditionally run from Chinese New Year's Eve, the last day of the last month of the Chinese calendar, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first month, making the festival the longest in the Chinese calendar. Because the Chinese calendar is lunisolar, the Chinese New Year is often referred to as the "<b>Lunar New Year</b>".</p>
<p>The source of Chinese New Year is itself centuries old and gains significance because of several myths and traditions. Traditionally, the festival was a time to honor deities as well as ancestors. Chinese New Year is celebrated in countries and territories with significant Chinese populations, including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mauritius, Philippines, and also in Chinatowns elsewhere. Chinese New Year is considered a major holiday for the Chinese and has had influence on the lunar new year celebrations of its geographic neighbors.</p>
<p>Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the Chinese new year vary widely. Often, the evening preceding Chinese New Year's Day is an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner. It is also traditional for every family to thoroughly cleanse the house, in order to sweep away any ill-fortune and to make way for good incoming luck. Windows and doors will be decorated with red color paper-cuts and couplets with popular themes of "good fortune" or "happiness", "wealth", and "longevity." Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in red paper envelopes.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese calendar traditionally does not use continuously numbered years, outside China its years are often numbered from the reign of the 3rd millennium BC Yellow Emperor. But at least three different years numbered 1 are now used by various scholars, making the year beginning AD 2013 the "Chinese Year" 4711, 4710, or 4650.</p>

<p>The original traditional product (<i>Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale</i>), made from a reduction of cooked white Trebbiano grape juice and not a vinegar in the usual sense, has been made in Modena and Reggio Emilia since the Middle Ages: the production of balsamic vinegar is mentioned in a document dated 1046. During the Renaissance, it was appreciated in the House of Este. Today, the traditional balsamic vinegar is highly valued by chefs and gourmet food lovers.</p>
<p>The names "<i>Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena</i>" (Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena) and "<i>Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia</i>" (Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia) are protected by both the Italian <i>Denominazione di origine protetta</i> and the European Union's Protected Designation of Origin.</p>
<p>Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (<i>Aceto Balsamico di Modena</i>), a less expensive imitation of the traditional product, is today widely available and much better known, but received PGI label. This is the kind commonly used for salad dressing together with oil. The word <i>balsamico</i> (from Latin <i>balsamum</i>, from Greek <i>βάλσαμον</i>) means "balsam-like" in the sense of "restorative" or "curative".</p>

He is titled in the company as "the longest-reigning WWE Champion of the modern era", having held the title for 434 days from November 20, 2011 to January 27, 2013. Punk is officially recognized as the sixth-longest reigning champion of all time.</p>
<p>In professional wrestling, Punk is a seven-time World Champion, having held the ROH World Championship and ECW Championship once each, WWE's World Heavyweight Championship three times, and the WWE Championship twice. He has also won the World Tag Team Championship (with Kofi Kingston) and the WWE Intercontinental Championship, making him the 19th WWE Triple Crown Champion and the fastest man in WWE history to achieve this record at 203 days. Between WWE and Ring of Honor (where he is a two-time World Tag Team Champion), Punk has won a total of 11 championships. He was also the winner of the 2008 and 2009 Money in the Bank ladder matches (the only wrestler to win the match twice in a row), and was the 2011 Superstar of the Year Slammy Award winner.</p>
<p>Punk initially came to prominence through his career on the professional wrestling independent circuit, primarily as a member of the ROH roster. There, he was the first head trainer of the ROH wrestling school. Also while competing in ROH, Punk won both the company's championships. In 2005, Punk signed a contract with WWE and was sent to its developmental promotion, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he won every championship available in that promotion. On June 24, 2006, Punk made his WWE television debut, performing in ECW, which was then a branch of WWE. Throughout his career, Punk has consistently used the gimmick of being an outspoken, sharp-tongued, and straight edge iconoclast. Punk's straight edge principles when in character are based on his actual way of life out of character. Depending on Punk's alignment as a fan favorite or villain, he has emphasized different aspects of the culture to arouse the desired audience reaction.</p>
