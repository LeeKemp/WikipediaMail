		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 19 November 2013 </h1><h2> The Old 76 House</h2><p><b>The Old '76 House</b> (the '76 House) was a Dutch-style house built during the founding of Tappan, New York in 1686. In 1755 the building was expanded by the Mabie family to include additional space for a tavern. The earliest recorded Tappan town meetings were held in the '76 House and it remains the oldest example of public Dutch architecture in America. Tappan's earliest town records were kept at the tavern. These documents describe meetings of the town elders and provide details of the food and ale they consumed.</p>

The concept was introduced in a 2008 paper by a pseudonymous developer known as "Satoshi Nakamoto".</p>
<p>Bitcoin has been called a cryptocurrency because it is decentralized and uses cryptography to control transactions and prevent double-spending, a problem for digital currencies. Once validated, every individual transaction is permanently recorded in a public ledger known as the blockchain. Payment processing is done by a network of private computers often specially tailored to this task. The operators of these computers, known as "miners", are rewarded with transaction fees and newly minted Bitcoins. However, new Bitcoins are created at an ever-decreasing rate.</p>
<p>In 2012, <i>The Economist</i> reasoned that Bitcoin has been popular because of "its role in dodgy online markets," and in 2013 the FBI shut down one such service, Silk Road, which specialized in illegal drugs (whereupon the FBI came into the control of approximately 1.5% of all bitcoins in circulation). However, Bitcoins are increasingly used as payment for legitimate products and services, and merchants have an incentive to accept the currency because transaction fees are lower than the 2 to 3% typically imposed by credit card processors. Notable vendors include WordPress, OkCupid, Reddit, and Chinese Internet giant Baidu.</p>
<p>Speculators have been attracted to Bitcoin, fueling volatility and price swings. As of July 2013, the use of Bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace is relatively small compared with the use by speculators.</p>
<p>Bitcoins are stored by associating them with addresses called "wallets". Wallets can be stored on web services, on local hardware like PCs and mobile devices, or on paper print-outs. Thefts of Bitcoins from web services and online wallets have been covered in the media, prompting assertions that the safest way to store Bitcoins is on secure paper wallets.</p>

This flag can indicate a state of war if it is displayed with the red side on top.</p>

Murphy, a native of Atlanta, moved to Los Angeles, California as a teenager, and pursued a career in acting. Her breakthrough role was in Amy Heckerling's <i>Clueless</i> (1995), followed by supporting roles in independent films such as <i>Freeway</i> (1996) and <i>Bongwater</i> (1998). She made her stage debut in a Broadway production of Arthur Miller's <i>A View from the Bridge</i> in 1997, and then appeared in James Mangold's critically-acclaimed drama <i>Girl, Interrupted</i> (1999), as well as the satire <i>Drop Dead Gorgeous</i> (1999).</p>
<p>The 2000s saw Murphy with roles in <i>Don't Say a Word</i> (2001) alongside Michael Douglas, and alongside Eminem in Curtis Hanson's <i>8 Mile</i> (2002), which she gained critical recognition for. Her later roles included the dark comedy crime film <i>Spun</i> (2002), <i>Uptown Girls</i> (2003) alongside Dakota Fanning, <i>Sin City</i> (2005), <i>Riding in Cars with Boys</i> (2005), and <i>Happy Feet</i> (2006). Murphy also voiced Luanne Platter on the animated TV series <i>King of the Hill</i>. Her final film, <i>Something Wicked</i>, is scheduled to be released in 2013.</p>
<p>Murphy died of apparent complications related to pneumonia and anaemia in December 2009, though, based on a recent toxicological report indicating high levels of heavy metals, it is suggested she may have died of poisoning.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Murphy' >More...</a><hr><h2> Gettysburg Address</h2><p>The <b>Gettysburg Address</b> is a speech by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, one of the best-known in American history. It was delivered by Lincoln during the American Civil War, on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863, at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, four and a half months after the Union armies defeated those of the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln's carefully crafted address, secondary to other presentations that day, came to be regarded as one of the greatest speeches in American history. In just over two minutes, Lincoln reiterated the principles of human equality espoused by the Declaration of Independence and proclaimed the Civil War as a struggle for the preservation of the Union sundered by the secession crisis, with "a new birth of freedom," that would bring true equality to all of its citizens. Lincoln also redefined the Civil War as a struggle not just for the Union, but also for the principle of human equality.</p>
<p>Beginning with the now-iconic phrase "Four score and seven years ago" — referring to the Declaration of Independence, written at the start of the American Revolution in 1776 — Lincoln examined the founding principles of the United States in the context of the Civil War, and memorialized the sacrifices of those who gave their lives at Gettysburg and extolled virtues for the listeners (and the nation) to ensure the survival of America's representative democracy, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."</p>
<p>Despite the speech's prominent place in the history and popular culture of the United States, the exact wording and location of the speech are disputed. The five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address differ in a number of details and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprints of the speech. Modern scholarship locates the speakers' platform 40 yards (or more) away from the <i>Traditional Site</i> within Soldiers' National Cemetery at the Soldiers' National Monument and entirely within private, adjacent Evergreen Cemetery.</p>

It is to be officially released on 25 November 2013, via Columbia Records, Syco Music and Sony Music, however on 18 November 2013, iTunes accidentally made the album available to multiple customers who had pre-ordered it, resulting in the album leaking. The album was described by the band as edgier, and as having a "slightly rockier tone" than their previous efforts. It has became the fastest selling pre-order album release in Amazon.com's fifteen-year history, breaking the record set by One Direction's previous release, <i>Take Me Home</i> (2012). The album was preceded by the release of the singles "Best Song Ever" and "Story of My Life".</p>

He played college football for the Auburn Tigers and was drafted as the first overall pick by the Panthers in the 2011 NFL Draft. He is the only third player (and the first since 1950) to be awarded the Heisman Trophy, win a national championship, and become the first overall pick in the NFL draft all in the same one-year span, joining Leon Hart and Angelo Bertelli.</p>
<p>In his rookie year, Newton broke numerous rookie and all-time NFL records for passing and running the ball. He became the first rookie quarterback to throw for 400 yards in his first game, shattering Peyton Manning's record by 120 yards. He also broke Otto Graham's 61-year-old record for passing yards by any quarterback in an NFL debut. Newton would go on to become the first rookie quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards in a season, as well as the first rookie QB to rush for 700 yards. He also ran for 14 touchdowns, more in a single season than any quarterback in NFL history, breaking Steve Grogan's 35-year-old record.</p>

The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord—a time-travelling humanoid alien known as the Doctor. He explores the universe in his TARDIS (acronym: Time and Relative Dimension in Space), a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.</p>
<p>The show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies's tenure as executive producer. In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor. In 2013, the Peabody Awards honoured <i>Doctor Who</i> with an Institutional Peabody "for evolving with technology and the times like nothing else in the known television universe." The programme is listed in <i>Guinness World Records</i> as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world and as the "most successful" science fiction series of all time—based on its over-all broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales, and iTunes traffic. During its original run, it was recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget special effects, and pioneering use of electronic music (originally produced by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop).</p>
<p>The show is a significant part of British popular culture; and elsewhere it has become a cult television favourite. The show has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. After an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot in the form of a television film, the programme was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T Davies who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff. Series 1 in the 21st century, featuring Christopher Eccleston as the ninth incarnation, was produced by the BBC. Series 2 and 3 had some development money contributed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), which was credited as a co-producer. <i>Doctor Who</i> also spawned spin-offs in multiple media, including <i>Torchwood</i> (2006–11) and <i>The Sarah Jane Adventures</i> (2007–11), both created by Russell T Davies; <i>K-9</i> (2009–10), the four-part video series <i>P.R.O.B.E.</i> (1994–96), and a single pilot episode of <i>K-9 and Company</i> (1981). There also have been many spoofs and cultural references of the character in other media.</p>
<p>Eleven actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show as regeneration, a life process of Time Lords through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality, which occurs after sustaining injury which would be fatal to most other species. Although each portrayal of the Doctor is different, and on occasions the various incarnations have even met one another, they are all meant to be aspects of the same character. The Doctor as of 2013 is portrayed by Matt Smith, who took up the role after David Tennant's last appearance. On 1 June 2013, it was announced that Matt Smith would leave the series and the eleventh Doctor would regenerate in the 2013 Christmas special. On 4 August 2013, Peter Capaldi was announced as the twelfth incarnation of the Doctor.</p>
