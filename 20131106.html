		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 06 November 2013 </h1><h2> Adwaita</h2><p><b>Adwaita</b> (meaning "non-duality" in Sanskrit) (c. 1750 – 23 March 2006) was a male Aldabra giant tortoise in the Alipore Zoological Gardens of Kolkata, India. He was amongst the longest-living animals in the world.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adwaita' >More...</a><hr><h2> Tab Clear</h2><p><b>Tab Clear</b>, a variation of Tab, was Coca-Cola's contribution to the short-lived "clear cola" movement during the early 1990s. It was introduced in the United States on December 14, 1992, in the United Kingdom a month later at the price of 23p, and in Japan in March 1993 to initially positive results. Tab Clear was, however, discontinued in the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan after only a short time of marketing, in mid-1994. Unlike most other "clear" soft drinks, Tab Clear contained caffeine, and according to the company, had the flavor of cola.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_Clear' >More...</a><hr><h2> Bill de Blasio</h2><p><b>Bill de Blasio</b> (born <b>Warren Wilhelm, Jr.</b>; May 8, 1961) is the Mayor-elect of New York City, currently holding the citywide office of New York City Public Advocate, which serves as an ombudsman between the electorate and the city government. He formerly served as a New York City Council member representing the 39th District in Brooklyn (Borough Park, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus, Kensington, Park Slope, and Windsor Terrace). He was the Democratic Party nominee in the 2013 election to become Mayor of New York City. On November 5, 2013, De Blasio won the mayoral election by a landslide, receiving over 73% of the vote and will become the first Democratic mayor of the city in nearly 20 years.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_de_Blasio' >More...</a><hr><h2> Vivien Leigh</h2><p><b>Vivien Leigh, Lady Olivier</b> (5 November 1913 – 8 July 1967) was a British stage and film actress. She won two Best Actress Academy Awards for her performances as "southern belles": Scarlett O'Hara in <i>Gone with the Wind</i> (1939) and Blanche DuBois in the film version of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i> (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's West End in 1949. She won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway version of <i>Tovarich</i> (1963).</p>
<p>After an education in drama school, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935, and progressed to the role of heroine in <i>Fire Over England</i> (1937). Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that it sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress. Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer. During her 30-year stage career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of Noël Coward and George Bernard Shaw comedies to classic Shakespearean characters such as Ophelia, Cleopatra, Juliet and Lady Macbeth. Later in life, she played character roles in a few films.</p>
<p>To the public at the time, Leigh was strongly identified with her second husband Laurence Olivier, to whom she was married from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films. For much of her adult life, she suffered from bipolar disorder. She earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, and her career suffered periods of inactivity. She suffered recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, first diagnosed in the mid-1940s, which ultimately claimed her life at the age of 53. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Leigh as the 16th greatest female movie star of all time.</p>

<p>The plan was to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of England's Parliament on 5 November 1605, as the prelude to a popular revolt in the Midlands during which James's nine-year-old daughter, Princess Elizabeth, was to be installed as the Catholic head of state. Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under King James had faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow plotters were John Wright, Thomas Wintour, Thomas Percy, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates, Robert Wintour, Christopher Wright, John Grant, Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. Fawkes, who had 10 years of military experience fighting in the Spanish Netherlands in suppression of the Dutch Revolt, was given charge of the explosives.</p>
<p>The plot was revealed to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, on 26 October 1605. During a search of the House of Lords at about midnight on 4 November 1605, Fawkes was discovered guarding 36 barrels of gunpowder—enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble—and arrested. Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned of the plot's discovery, trying to enlist support along the way. Several made a stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men at Holbeche House; in the ensuing battle Catesby was one of those shot and killed. At their trial on 27 January 1606, eight of the survivors, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered.</p>
<p>Details of the assassination attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although he was convicted of treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot' >More...</a><hr><h2> Business administration</h2><p>The <b>administration of a business</b> includes the performance or management of business operations and decision making as well as the efficient organization of people and other resources to direct activities toward common goals and objectives.</p>
<p>The word is derived from the Middle English word <i>administracioun</i>, which came from the French <i>administration</i>, itself derived from the Latin <i>administratio</i> — a compounding of <i>ad</i> ("to") and <i>ministrare</i> ("give service").</p>
<p><b>Administrator</b> is occasionally the title of the general manager or company secretary who reports to a corporate board of directors. This usage is archaic<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup>. In general, administration refers to the broader management function, including the associated finance, personnel and MIS services.</p>
<p>In some organizational analyses, management is viewed as a subset of administration, specifically associated with the technical and operational aspects of an organization, distinct from executive or strategic functions.</p>
<p>Alternatively, administration can refer to the bureaucratic or operational performance of routine office tasks, usually internally oriented and reactive rather than proactive.</p>
<p>Administrators, broadly speaking, engage in a common set of functions to meet the organization's goals. These "functions" of the administrator were described by Henri Fayol as "the six elements of administration" (see below).</p>
<ul><li><b>Planning</b> – is deciding in advance what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and who should do it. It maps the path from where the organization is to where it wants to be. The planning function involves establishing goals and arranging them in a logical order. Administrators engage in both short-range and long-range planning.</li>
<li><b>Organizing</b> – involves identifying responsibilities, grouping them into departments or divisions, and specifying organizational relationships.</li>
<li><b>Coordinating</b> synchronizes the elements of the organization and must take into account delegation of authority and responsibility and span of control within units.</li>
<li><b>Directing</b> (<b>Commanding</b>) – is leading people in a manner that achieves the goals of the organization. This requires proper allocation of resources and an effective support system. Directing requires exceptional interpersonal skills and the ability to motivate people. One of the crucial issues in directing is the correct balance between staff needs and production.</li>
<li><b>Controlling</b> – is a monitoring function that evaluates quality in all areas and detects potential or actual deviations from the organization's plan, ensuring high-quality performance and satisfactory results while maintaining an orderly and problem-free environment. Controlling includes information management, measurement of performance, and institution of corrective actions.</li>
<li><b>Budgeting</b> – separate from the list above, budgeting incorporates most of the administrative functions, from the implementation of a budget plan through the application of budget controls.</li>

He is the 64th and current Mayor of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Ford was elected mayor in the 2010 mayoral election, and took office on December 1 of that year.</p>
<p>Prior to being mayor, Ford was city councillor for a ward in the Toronto district of Etobicoke. He was first elected to city council in the 2000 Toronto municipal election, and was re-elected to his council seat in 2003 and again in 2006. His brother Doug Ford, Jr. is currently a Toronto city councillor. Ford's father Doug Ford, Sr. was also a politician and served as MPP. The Ford family owns Deco Labels, a multi-national labelling and printing firm based in Etobicoke.</p>
<p>During his political career, Ford has been the subject of a number of personal and work-related controversies and legal proceedings, including a conflict of interest trial that nearly removed him from office. In 2013, he became the subject of allegations of substance abuse, which were widely reported in the national and international media, These allegations continued amidst a 2013 Toronto Police Service investigation which includes Mayor Ford. These allegations were eventually admitted by Ford, who suggested he did use crack cocaine "probably in one of my drunken stupors".</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Ford' >More...</a><hr><h2> Australia</h2><p><b>Australia</b> /əˈstreɪljə, ɒ-, -iə/, officially the <b>Commonwealth of Australia</b>, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. Neighbouring countries include Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea to the north; the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.</p>
<p>For at least 40,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians, who spoke languages grouped into roughly 250 language groups. After the discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing Crown Colonies were established.</p>
<p>On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Since Federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy. The federation comprises six states and several territories. The population of 23.1 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states.</p>
<p>Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the world's 12th-largest economy. In 2012 Australia had the world's fifth-highest per capita income, Australia's military expenditure is the world's 13th-largest. With the second-highest human development index globally, Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil liberties and political rights. Australia is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Pacific Islands Forum.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia' >More...</a><hr><h2> Charlie Trotter</h2><p><b>Charles</b> "<b>Charlie</b>" <b>Trotter</b> (September 8, 1959 – November 5, 2013) was an American chef and restaurateur.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Trotter' >More...</a><hr><h2> Brazilian wandering spider</h2><p><i><b>Phoneutria</b></i>, commonly known as <b>Brazilian wandering spiders</b>, <b>armed spiders</b> ("armadeiras", as they are known in Portuguese), or <b>banana spiders</b> (not to be confused with the relatively harmless <i>Nephila</i>), are a genus of aggressive and venomous spiders of potential medical significance to humans. They are mainly found in tropical South America, with one species in Central America. These spiders are members of the Ctenidae family of wandering spiders.</p>
<p>The Brazilian wandering spiders appear in <i>Guinness World Records</i> from 2010 as the world's most venomous spider. Guinness World Records states that although the Brazilian wandering spider is the most toxic, an effective antivenom is available and few fatalities occur.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_wandering_spider' >More...</a><hr><h2> Robert Chesebrough</h2><p><b>Sir Robert Augustus Chesebrough</b>, (January 9, 1837 – September 8, 1933) was a chemist and the inventor of petroleum jelly, which he trade-named as Vaseline. In 1875 he founded the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company that in 1955 became Chesebrough-Ponds, a leading manufacturer of personal care products. Chesebrough patented the process of making petroleum jelly (U.S. Patent 127,568) in 1872. Born in London, Chesebrough began his career as a chemist clarifying kerosene from the oil of sperm whales. The discovery of petroleum in Titusville, Pennsylvania rendered his job obsolete, so he traveled to Titusville to research what new materials might be created from the new fuel.</p>
<p>Chesebrough's success stemmed from firm belief in his product. Before Chesebrough began selling petroleum jelly, he tested it on his own cuts and burns. Having demonstrated the product's efficacy on himself, Chesebrough was still unable to sell any to drug stores until he travelled around New York State demonstrating his miracle product. In front of an audience he would burn his skin with acid or an open flame, then spread the clear jelly on his injuries while demonstrating past injuries, healed, he claimed, by his miracle product. To further create demand, he gave out free samples.</p>
<p>Chesebrough opened his first factory in 1870. The first known reference to the name Vaseline is in his U.S. patent: “I, Robert Chesebrough, have invented a new and useful product from petroleum which I have named 'Vaseline…'" . The etymology of the word is believed to come from German wasser (water) + Greek έλαιον (oil).</p>
<p>Chesebrough lived to be 96 years old and was such a believer in Vaseline that he claimed to have eaten a spoonful of it every day. He died at his house in Spring Lake, New Jersey. He also, reportedly, during a serious bout of pleurisy in his mid-50s, had his nurse rub him from head to foot with the substance. He soon recovered.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Chesebrough' >More...</a><hr><h2> Liquor license</h2><p>A <b>liquor license</b> is a permit to sell alcoholic beverages.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor_license' >More...</a><hr><h2> Jimi Hendrix</h2><p><b>James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix</b> (born <b>Johnny Allen Hendrix</b>; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. Despite a relatively brief mainstream exposure of four years, he is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century.</p>
<p>In 1961, Hendrix enlisted in the US Army; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the chitlin' circuit. He eventually earned a spot in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later found work with Little Richard, with whom he continued to play through mid-1965. He then joined Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after having been discovered by bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals. In 1967, Hendrix earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: "Hey Joe", "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival later that year. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before dying from barbiturate-related asphyxia at the age of 27.</p>
<p>Hendrix was inspired musically by American rock and roll and electric blues, and he favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain. He was instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback, and he helped to popularize the use of a wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock. He was the first artist to use stereophonic phasing effects in music recordings. Holly George-Warren of <i>Rolling Stone</i> commented: "Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began."</p>
<p>Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously; the Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked his three non-posthumous studio albums, <i>Are You Experienced</i>, <i>Axis: Bold as Love</i>, and <i>Electric Ladyland</i> among the 100 greatest albums of all time and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-11-06 11:30:20 -0500 -->
