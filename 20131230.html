		<h1>Popular Pages - Monday 30 December 2013 </h1><h2> Michael Schumacher</h2><p><b>Michael Schumacher</b> (<small>German pronunciation:</small> [ˈmɪçaʔɛl ˈʃuːmaxɐ]<small class="nowrap"> ( )</small>; born 3 January 1969) is a retired German racing driver. Schumacher is a seven-time Formula One World Champion and is widely regarded as one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time. He holds many of Formula One's driver records, including most championships, race victories, fastest laps, pole positions and most races won in a single season – 13 in 2004. In 2002 he became the only driver in Formula One history to finish in the top three in every race of a season and then also broke the record for most consecutive podium finishes. According to the official Formula One website, he is "statistically the greatest driver the sport has ever seen".</p>
<p>After beginning with karting, Schumacher won German drivers' championships in Formula König and Formula Three before joining Mercedes in the World Sportscar Championship. After one Mercedes-funded race for the Jordan Formula One team, Schumacher signed as a driver for the Benetton Formula One team in 1991. After winning consecutive championships with Benetton in 1994/5, Schumacher moved to Ferrari in 1996 and won another five consecutive drivers' titles with them from 2000 to 2004. Schumacher retired from Formula One driving in 2006 staying with Ferrari as an advisor. Schumacher agreed to return for Ferrari part-way through 2009, as cover for the badly injured Felipe Massa, but was prevented by a neck injury. He later signed a three-year contract to drive for the new Mercedes team starting in 2010.</p>
<p>His career has not been without controversy, including being twice involved in collisions in the final race of a season that determined the outcome of the world championship, with Damon Hill in 1994 in Adelaide, and with Jacques Villeneuve in 1997 in Jerez. Off the track Schumacher is an ambassador for UNESCO and a spokesman for driver safety. He has been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts throughout his life and donated tens of millions of dollars to charity. Michael and his younger brother Ralf Schumacher are the only brothers to win races in Formula One, and they were the first brothers to finish 1st and 2nd in the same race, in Montreal in 2001. The two brothers repeated this achievement in four more races (the 2001 French Grand Prix, the 2002 Brazilian Grand Prix, the 2003 Canadian Grand Prix and the 2004 Japanese Grand Prix).</p>

<p>Wilson is best known for leading Congress into supporting Operation Cyclone, the largest-ever Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) covert operation which, under the Reagan administration, supplied military equipment including anti-aircraft weapons such as Stinger antiaircraft missiles and paramilitary officers from their Special Activities Division to the Afghan Mujahideen during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. His behind-the-scenes campaign was the subject of the non-fiction book <i>Charlie Wilson's War</i> by George Crile III and a subsequent film adaptation starring Tom Hanks as Wilson.</p>

He played college football for Purdue, where he started four straight bowl games. He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft. After an injury to Bears starter Rex Grossman, Orton was pressed into service as the starting quarterback during his rookie year, starting the first 14 games of the 2005 season, but was replaced by Grossman for the playoffs that year. Orton did not play at all in 2006, and sparingly in 2007. Orton regained his starting job from Grossman in 2008, but the team finished a disappointing 9-7 and out of the playoffs. In the offseason of that year, he was traded to the Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>Orton started his Broncos career by winning his first six games in the 2009 season, but injuries hobbled him in the second half of the season. Though Orton threw 21 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions, the team finished 8-8 and out of the playoffs. Orton started 2010 season as the starting quarterback, though the team was not competitive most of the season, finishing 4-12. After throwing 3 interceptions versus the Arizona Cardinals on December 12 and with the Broncos eliminated from the playoffs, Orton was replaced by Tim Tebow for the final three games of the 2010 season. In 2011 he again began the season as a starter, but he was replaced by Tebow again after a disappointing start to the season. Following several weeks on the bench, in which he did not take a snap for the Broncos, he was released by the Broncos on November 22, and claimed off of waivers by the Kansas City Chiefs the next day. His contract expired and the Dallas Cowboys signed him on March 14, 2012 off of free agency.</p>

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIE_fighter' >More...</a><hr><h2> Stone Temple Pilots</h2><p><b>Stone Temple Pilots</b> (often abbreviated <b>STP</b>), currently known as <b>Stone Temple Pilots with Chester Bennington</b>, is an American rock band from San Diego, California, that currently consists of brothers Robert (bass, backing vocals) and Dean DeLeo (guitar), Eric Kretz (drums, percussion), and Chester Bennington (lead vocals). Since its formation, STP's line-up had remained unchanged until the dismissal of lead vocalist Scott Weiland in 2013 and the subsequent addition of Bennington of Linkin Park fame as his replacement vocalist.</p>
<p>After forming in 1985 under the name Mighty Joe Young, the band signed with Atlantic Records and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots. STP found immediate success in 1993 after releasing their debut album <i>Core</i> (1992), and went on to become one of the most commercially successful bands of the 1990s. The band released four more studio albums: <i>Purple</i> (1994), <i>Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop</i> (1996), <i>No. 4</i> (1999) and <i>Shangri-La Dee Da</i> (2001) before separating in 2003, after which the band members partook in various projects, most notably Velvet Revolver and Army of Anyone. STP eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour, released a new self-titled album in 2010, and have been actively touring since, although Weiland was fired from the band and was replaced by Bennington in 2013. The band's first material with Bennington, the EP <i>High Rise</i>, was released October 8.</p>
<p>While initially displaying a sound typically identified as grunge early on in its career, further releases from the band expressed a variety of influences, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova and classic rock. The band's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved several tumultuous periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.</p>
