  extract: |-
    <p><b>Narendra Damodardas Modi</b> ( pronunciation , born 17 September 1950) is the designated Prime Minister of India, set to take office soon after leading the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a decisive victory in the 2014 general elections. After taking office, Modi will become the first prime minister of India born after the country's independence. Modi is also the 14th and current Chief Minister of Gujarat, though he is expected to resign soon to take up the office of Prime Minister.</p>
    <p>Modi was a key strategist for the BJP in the successful 1995 and 1998 Gujarat state election campaigns, and was a major campaign figure in the 2009 general elections, eventually won by the Indian National Congress led United Progressive Alliance (UPA). He first became chief minister of Gujarat in October 2001 after the resignation of his predecessor, Keshubhai Patel, and following the defeat of BJP in the by-elections. In July 2007, he became the longest-serving Chief Minister in Gujarat's history, at which point he had been in power for 2,063 days continuously. He is currently serving his fourth consecutive term as Chief Minister.</p>
    <p>Modi is a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and is described as a Hindu nationalist by media, scholars and himself. He is a controversial figure both within India and internationally as his administration has been criticised for the incidents surrounding the 2002 Gujarat riots. He has been praised for his economic policies, which are credited with creating an environment for a high rate of economic growth in Gujarat. However, his administration has also been criticised for failing to make a significant positive impact upon the human development of the state.</p>

    <p><b>Godzilla</b> (ゴジラ, <i>Gojira</i><sup class="t_nihongo_help noprint">?</sup>) (/ɡɒdˈzɪlə/; [ɡoꜜdʑiɽa]<small class="nowrap"> ( )</small>) is a giant monster or daikaiju originating from a series of tokusatsu films of the same name from Japan. He first appeared in Ishirō Honda's 1954 film <i>Godzilla</i>. Since then, Godzilla has gone on to become a worldwide pop culture icon starring in 28 films produced by Toho Co., Ltd.. The character has appeared in numerous other medium incarnations including video games, novels, comic books, and television series. A 1998 American reimagining was produced by Tri-Star Pictures (the title monster of which was renamed to Zilla by Toho in 2004's <i>Godzilla: Final Wars</i>), while a second American version by Legendary Pictures was released on May 16, 2014. The character is commonly alluded to by the title <b>King of the Monsters</b>, an epithet first used in the Americanized version of Ishiro Honda's original 1954 film.</p>
    <p>With the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the <i>Lucky Dragon 5</i> incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for nuclear weapons. As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones portraying Godzilla as a hero while other plots still portrayed Godzilla as a destructive monster; sometimes the lesser of two threats who plays the defender by default but is still a danger to humanity.</p>

  title: California Chrome
  extract: |-
    <p><b>California Chrome</b> (foaled February 18, 2011) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse bred in California. He has won the 2014 Kentucky Derby and the 2014 Preakness Stakes, extending a winning streak to six races that also included the Santa Anita Derby and the San Felipe Stakes. Trained by the father-son team of Art Sherman and Alan Sherman, the colt was the first horse they entered in the Kentucky Derby. As a young man, the elder Sherman was the exercise rider for the 1955 Kentucky Derby winner Swaps, another California-bred horse. California Chrome's owners are Perry and Denise Martin from Yuba City, California and Steve and Carolyn Coburn of Topaz Lake, Nevada.</p>
    <p>A grandson of Pulpit, with two lines to Swaps on his dam's side of his pedigree, the chestnut-colored horse was named for his flashy white markings, called "chrome" in the world of horse aficionados. California Chrome was a large foal at birth and was the first foal of his dam, Love The Chase. Nicknamed "Junior" in honor of his sire, Lucky Pulpit, he was sent to the Shermans' training stable as a two-year-old owing to their reputation for patiently developing young horses. The colt's first win was in his second race, but he had trouble winning consistently until he was paired with jockey Victor Espinoza for the King Glorious Stakes on December 22, 2013. He won that race and has been undefeated since.</p>
    <p>Arriving in Kentucky less than a week before the Derby, the colt drew the 5th post position and was the morning line favorite, though analysts at Churchill Downs were critical of the colt, his trainer's strategy, and downplayed his chances of winning. He won by 1<sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> lengths, even after being eased for the final 70 yards (64 m), in a ride by Espinoza that Art Sherman described as "perfect". Shipping to Pimlico Race Course the Monday prior to the race, a minor media frenzy erupted on Thursday when the horse was noticed coughing after a workout. Given a clean bill of health by a veterinarian, he started at 3–5 odds as the favorite and won by 1-<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> lengths.</p>

  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>Preakness Stakes</b> is an American flat thoroughbred horse race held on the third Saturday in May each year at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. It is a Grade 1 race run over a distance of 9.5 furlongs (1 3/16 miles) on dirt. Colts and geldings carry 126 pounds (57 kg); fillies 121 lb (55 kg). It is the second leg of the US Triple Crown, following the Kentucky Derby and followed by the Belmont Stakes.</p>
    <p>First run in 1873, the Preakness Stakes was named by a former Maryland Governor after a winning colt at Pimlico. The race has been termed "The Run for the Black-Eyed Susans" because a blanket of yellow flowers altered to resemble Maryland's state flower is placed around the winner's neck. Attendance at the Preakness Stakes ranks second in North America only trailing the Kentucky Derby.</p>
    <p>The 139th running of <b>The Preakness Stakes</b> took place on Saturday, May 17, 2014 for a purse of $1,500,000.</p>
