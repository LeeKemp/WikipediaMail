		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 11 December 2013 </h1><h2> Fannie Mae</h2><p>The <b>Federal National Mortgage Association</b> (<b>FNMA</b>), commonly known as <b>Fannie Mae</b>, was founded in 1938 during the Great Depression as part of the New Deal. It is a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), though it has been a publicly traded company since 1968. The corporation's purpose is to expand the secondary mortgage market by securitizing mortgages in the form of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), allowing lenders to reinvest their assets into more lending and in effect increasing the number of lenders in the mortgage market by reducing the reliance on locally-based savings and loan associations (aka "thrifts").

It is the second <i>Godzilla</i> film to be fully filmed by an American studio, the first having been the 1998 film of the same name. The film retells the origin of Godzilla in contemporary times as a "terrifying force of nature". The film is directed by Gareth Edwards and stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, David Strathairn, Sally Hawkins and Ken Watanabe.</p>
<p>The film is a co-production of Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures and will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures worldwide, except for Japan where it will be distributed by Toho. The film is scheduled to be released on May 16, 2014 in 2D and 3D.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_(2014_film)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Godzilla</h2><p><b>Godzilla</b> (ゴジラ, <i>Gojira</i><sup>?</sup>) (/ɡɒdˈzɪlə/; [ɡoꜜdʑiɽa]<small class="nowrap"> ( )</small>) is a Kaiju first appearing in Ishirō Honda's 1954 film <i>Godzilla</i>. Since then, Godzilla has gone on to become a worldwide pop culture icon starring in 28 films produced by Toho Co., Ltd.. The monster has appeared in numerous other media incarnations including video games, novels, comic books, and television series. A 1998 American reimagining was produced and a second American version is currently undergoing post-production. The character is commonly alluded to by the title <b>King of the Monsters</b>, an epithet first used in the Americanized version of the original 1954 film.</p>
<p>With the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the <i>Lucky Dragon 5</i> incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for nuclear weapons. As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones portraying Godzilla as a hero while other plots still portrayed Godzilla as a destructive monster; sometimes the lesser of two threats who plays the defender by default but is still a danger to humanity.</p>
