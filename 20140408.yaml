  title: Game of Thrones
  extract: |-
    <p><i><b>Game of Thrones</b></i> is an American fantasy drama television series created for HBO by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is titled <i>A Game of Thrones</i>. Filmed in a Belfast studio and on location elsewhere in Northern Ireland, Malta, Scotland, Croatia, Iceland and Morocco, it premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011. The series was renewed for a fourth season, which debuted in the United States on April 6, 2014.</p>
    <p>The series, set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos at the end of a decade-long summer, interweaves several plot lines. The first follows the members of several noble houses in a civil war for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms; the second covers the rising threat of the impending winter and the mythical creatures of the North; the third chronicles the attempts of the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed dynasty to reclaim the throne. Through its morally ambiguous characters, the series explores the issues of social hierarchy, religion, loyalty, corruption, civil war, crime, and punishment. It is the most recent big-budget work to have contributed to the popularity of the fantasy genre in mainstream media.</p>
    <p><i>Game of Thrones</i> has obtained an exceptionally broad and active international fan base. It received widespread acclaim by critics, although its use of nudity and violence has caused controversy. The series has won numerous awards and nominations, including a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Drama Series in all three seasons, a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Television Series – Drama, a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in Long Form, and a Peabody Award. Among the ensemble cast, Peter Dinklage won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for his role as Tyrion Lannister.</p>

  extract: |-
    <p><b>Java</b> (Indonesian: <i><b>Jawa</b></i>; Javanese: ꦗꦮ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population roughly equal to Russia as of 2014, (excluding the 3.7 million on the island of Madura which is administered as part of the province of East Java), Java is the world's most populous island, and one of the most densely populated places in the world. Java is the home of 57 percent of the Indonesian population. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 40s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.</p>
    <p>Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions, Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in Indonesia. A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east-west spine along the island. It has three main languages, with Javanese being the dominant language; it is the native language of about 60 million people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java. Most of its residents are bilingual, with Indonesian as their first or second languages. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java has a diverse mixture of religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.</p>
    <p>Java is divided into four provinces, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Banten, and also two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.</p>

  extract: |-
    <p><b>Mark William Calaway</b> (born March 24, 1965), better known by his ring name <b>The Undertaker</b> (sometimes simply <b>Taker</b>), is an American professional wrestler signed to WWE. An employee of the company since 1990, he is its most tenured performer, and the only remaining active competitor from the very first episode of <i>WWE Raw</i> in 1993. Calaway began his wrestling career with World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) in 1984. He joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as <b>"Mean" Mark Callous</b> in 1989. When WCW did not renew Calaway's contract in 1990, he signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). After debuting as <b>Kane the Undertaker</b>, the name was shortened to The Undertaker and he has remained with the company since. Nicknamed "The Deadman", he is portrayed as an undead and macabre entity who uses scare tactics. The Undertaker has also used the alternate identity of a biker dubbed the "American Bad-Ass", which he portrayed from May 2000 to November 2003. His half-brother, Kane, is also a character within WWE; the pair have both feuded, and allied as a tag team called the Brothers of Destruction.</p>
    <p>The Undertaker holds an unrivaled record at WrestleMania, WWE's premier annual pay-per-view event, with a 21–0 undefeated streak (with no appearances at WrestleMania X and 2000) before being beaten by Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania XXX. Another similar achievement was from December 1991 to September 1993, when he did not lose a single match, marking the longest undefeated streak in WWF in the 90s.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> Calaway is an eight-time World Champion having won the WWF/E Championship four times and the World Heavyweight Championship three times as The Undertaker, and the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship once under his Master of Pain character. The Undertaker is also a seven-time Tag Team champion: a six-time World Tag Team Champion and one-time WCW World Tag Team Champion. The Undertaker was the winner of the 2007 Royal Rumble and became the first man to enter the annual event last and win.</p>

    <p><b>Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer</b> (May 21, 1960 – November 28, 1994), also known as the <b>Milwaukee Cannibal</b>, was an American serial killer and sex offender, who committed the rape, murder and dismemberment of 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991, with many of his later murders also involving necrophilia, cannibalism and the permanent preservation of body parts—typically all or part of the skeletal structure.</p>
