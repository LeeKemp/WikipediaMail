<p>The 2014 UEFA Champions League Final will be played at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal. Bayern Munich are the defending champions.</p>
<p>For the first time, the teams who qualified for the group stage also qualified for the newly formed 2013–14 UEFA Youth League, a competition available to players aged 19 or under.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_UEFA_Champions_League' >More...</a><hr><h2> Mona Lisa</h2><p>The <i><b>Mona Lisa</b></i> (<i><b>Monna Lisa</b></i> or <i><b>La Gioconda</b></i> in Italian; <i><b>La Joconde</b></i> in French) is a half-length portrait of a woman by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, which has been acclaimed as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world."</p>
<p>The painting, thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel, and is believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506, although Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at The Louvre museum in Paris since 1797. The ambiguity of the subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modeling of forms and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work.<br></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa' >More...</a><hr><h2> Sons of Anarchy</h2><p><i><b>Sons of Anarchy</b></i> is an American television drama series created by Kurt Sutter about the lives of a close-knit outlaw motorcycle club operating in Charming, a fictional town in California's Central Valley. The show centers on protagonist Jackson "Jax" Teller (Charlie Hunnam), the then–vice president of the club, who begins questioning the club and himself.</p>
<p><i>Sons of Anarchy</i> premiered on September 3, 2008, on cable network FX. The third season of the series attracted an average of 4.9 million viewers per week, making it FX's highest rated series ever, surpassing FX's other hits <i>The Shield</i>, <i>Nip/Tuck</i>, and <i>Rescue Me</i>. The season 4 and 5 premieres ("Out" and "Sovereign", respectively), both directed by series executive producer and principal director Paris Barclay and written by series creator and executive producer Kurt Sutter (along with staff writers Brady Dahl and Roberto Patino), were the two highest-rated telecasts in FX's history.</p>
<p>The sixth season aired from September 10 through December 10, 2013. Those involved in the production of the series imply that creator Kurt Sutter plans a seventh and final season.</p>
<p>In November 2013, Kurt Sutter indicated that he was in talks with FX to make a Sons of Anarchy prequel set in the 1960's</p>

<p>Although the "GED" initialism is frequently mistaken as meaning "general education degree" or "general education diploma", the American Council on Education, which owns the GED trademark, coined the initialism to identify "tests of <b>g</b>eneral <b>e</b>ducational <b>d</b>evelopment" that measure proficiency in science, mathematics, social studies, reading, and writing. Passing the GED test gives those who did not complete high school the opportunity to earn their high school equivalency credential, in the United States or Canada or abroad.</p>
<p>The GED Testing Service, now a joint venture of the American Council on Education and Pearson, is the sole developer for the GED test. The test can be taken by paper or on computer, but tests must be taken in person. Jurisdictions award a <b>Certificate of High School Equivalency</b> or similarly titled credential to persons who meet the passing score requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to English, the GED tests are available in Spanish, French, large print, audio cassette, and braille. Tests and test preparation are also offered to persons incarcerated and on military bases in addition to more traditional settings. Individuals living outside the United States, Canada, or U.S. territories may be eligible to take the GED tests through Pearson Vue testing centers.</p>
