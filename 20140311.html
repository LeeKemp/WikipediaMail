		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 11 March 2014 </h1><h2> Flag of Bikini Atoll</h2><p>The <b>flag of Bikini Atoll</b>, a member of the Marshall Islands, is a flag closely resembling the flag of the United States and was adopted in 1987. The flag is symbolic of the islanders' belief that a great debt is still owed by the United States to the people of Bikini because in 1954 the United States government detonated the Castle Bravo H-bomb on the island, poisoning islanders and others with nuclear fallout.</p>

The latter may require many rides from different people. A ride is usually, but not always, free. If the hitchhiker wishes to indicate that they need a ride, they may simply make a physical gesture or display a written sign. In North America, United Kingdom and most Western and Central Europe, the gesture involves extending the hitchhiker's arm toward the road and sticking the thumb of their outstretched hand upward with the hand closed. In other parts of the world, it is more common to use a gesture where the index finger is pointed at the road.</p>
<p>Itinerants have also used hitchhiking as a primary mode of travel for the better part of the last century, and continue to do so today.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchhiking' >More...</a><hr><h2> Internet</h2><p>The <b>Internet</b> is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to serve several billion users worldwide. It is a <i>network of networks</i> that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents of the World Wide Web (WWW), the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks.</p>
<p>The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks. While this work, together with work in the United Kingdom and France, led to important precursor networks, they were not the Internet. There is no consensus on the exact date when the modern Internet came into being, but sometime in the early to mid-1980s is considered reasonable.</p>
<p>The funding of a new U.S. backbone by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial backbones, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. Though the Internet has been widely used by academia since the 1980s, the commercialization of what was by the 1990s an international network resulted in its popularization and incorporation into virtually every aspect of modern human life. As of June 2012<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup>, more than 2.4 billion people—over a third of the world's human population—have used the services of the Internet; approximately 100 times more people than were using it in 1995. Internet use grew rapidly in the West from the mid-1990s to early 2000s and from the late 1990s to present in the developing world. In 1994 only 3% of American classrooms had the Internet while by 2002 92% did.</p>
<p>Most traditional communications media including telephone, music, film, and television are being reshaped or redefined by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Internet Protocol television (IPTV). Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology, or are reshaped into blogging and web feeds. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of human interactions through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking. Online shopping has boomed both for major retail outlets and small artisans and traders. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries.</p>
<p>The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. Only the overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces in the Internet, the Internet Protocol address space and the Domain Name System, are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.</p>

In addition to his solo career, Eminem is a member of his group D12, as well as one half of the hip hop duo Bad Meets Evil, alongside Royce da 5'9". Eminem is one of the world's best-selling music artists and is the best-selling artist of the 2000s. He has been listed and ranked as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine which ranked him 82nd on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The same magazine declared him The King of Hip Hop. Including his work with D12 and Bad Meets Evil, Eminem has achieved ten number-one albums on the <i>Billboard</i> 200.

<p>After releasing his independent debut album <i>Infinite</i> in August 1996, Eminem rose to mainstream popularity with the release of his February 1999 album <i>The Slim Shady LP</i>. The LP also earned Eminem his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. <i>The Slim Shady LP</i> was followed by <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i> in May 2000 and <i>The Eminem Show</i> in late May 2002, both of which also won Best Rap Album Grammy Awards, making Eminem the first artist to win Best Rap Album for three consecutive LPs. This was followed by another studio release in November 2004 titled <i>Encore</i>. Eminem then went on hiatus after touring in 2005. He released his sixth album <i>Relapse</i> in May 2009. In June 2010, Eminem released his seventh studio album <i>Recovery</i>. <i>Recovery</i> was an international success and was named the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, becoming the rapper's second album, after <i>The Eminem Show</i>, to become the internationally best-selling album of its year. Eminem won Grammy Awards for both <i>Relapse</i> and <i>Recovery</i>, giving him a total of 13 Grammys in his career. His eighth studio album, <i>The Marshall Mathers LP 2</i> was released on November 5, 2013.</p>

<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem' >More...</a><hr><h2> John Cazale</h2><p><b>John Holland Cazale</b> (/kəˈzeɪl/; <small>Italian pronunciation: </small>[kaˈdzaːle]; August 12, 1935 – March 12, 1978) was an American actor. During his six-year film career he appeared in five films, each nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture: <i>The Godfather</i>, <i>The Conversation</i>, <i>The Godfather Part II</i>, <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i> and <i>The Deer Hunter.</i> He appeared in archival footage in <i>The Godfather III</i>, which was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. He is the only actor to have this multi-film distinction. From his start as an acclaimed theater actor, he became one of Hollywood's premier character actors, starting with his role as Fredo Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's film <i>The Godfather</i>.</p>
<p>"Cazale broke hearts on screen with portrayals of volatile, vulnerable, vacillating men, including Pacino's tragic bank-robbing partner in <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i>," wrote David Germain of the Associated Press. Cazale is described as an actor "whose intense face is known to just about any serious cinema fan but whose name often escapes them".</p>
<p>He chose to continue acting despite being diagnosed with cancer and died in New York City on March 12, 1978, shortly after completing his role in <i>The Deer Hunter</i>. He was 42 years old.</p>
<p>Cazale was characterized as "an amazing intellect, an extraordinary person and a fine, dedicated artist" by Joseph Papp. A film documentary and tribute about Cazale, titled <i>I Knew It Was You</i>, was an entry at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and featured interviews with Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Gene Hackman, Richard Dreyfuss, Francis Ford Coppola and Sidney Lumet.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cazale' >More...</a><hr><h2> Greater Germanic Reich</h2><p>The <b>Greater Germanic Reich</b> (German: <i>Großgermanisches Reich</i>), fully styled the <b>Greater Germanic Reich of the German Nation</b> (German: <i>Großgermanisches Reich Deutscher Nation</i>) is the official state name of the political entity that Nazi Germany tried to establish in Europe during World War II. Albert Speer stated in his memoirs that Hitler also referred to the envisioned state as the <b>Teutonic Reich of the German Nation</b>, although it is unclear whether Speer was using the now seldom used "Teutonic" as an English synonym for "Germanic". Hitler also mentions a future <b>Germanic State of the German Nation</b> (German: <i>Germanischer Staat Deutscher Nation</i>) in <i>Mein Kampf</i>. The territorial claims for the Greater Germanic Reich vacillated over time, for instance amidst and for a short time after German-Soviet negotiations for the partition of Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union took place, Hitler did not include territorial designs on the Soviet Union within the Greater Germanic Reich from 1939 to 1941, and instead was focusing on uniting the Germanic peoples of Scandinavia and the Low Countries into the Reich.</p>
<p>This pan-Germanic Empire was expected to assimilate practically all of Germanic Europe into an enormously expanded Reich. Territorially speaking, this encompassed the already-enlarged German Reich itself (consisting of pre-1938 Germany proper, Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Alsace-Lorraine, Eupen-Malmedy, Memel, Lower Styria, Upper Carniola, Southern Carinthia and German-occupied Poland), the Netherlands, the Flemish part of Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, at least the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, and Liechtenstein.</p>
<p>The most notable exception was the predominantly Anglo-Saxon United Kingdom, which was not projected as having to be reduced to a German province but to instead become an allied seafaring partner of the Germans. Another exception was German-populated territory in South Tyrol that was part of allied Italy.</p>
<p>In addition, its western frontiers with France were to be reverted to those of the earlier Holy Roman Empire, which would have meant the complete annexation of all of Wallonia, French Switzerland, and large areas of northern and eastern France. The policy of <i>lebensraum</i> planned mass expansion of Germany eastwards to the Ural Mountains. Hitler planned for the "surplus" Russian population living west of the Urals to be deported to the east of the Urals.</p>
