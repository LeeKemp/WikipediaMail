		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 31 January 2014 </h1><h2> Jean Calvin</h2><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Calvin' >More...</a><hr><h2> Amanda Knox</h2><p><b>Amanda Marie Knox</b> (born July 9, 1987) is an American woman who, in 2009, was convicted of the murder of Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Umbria, Italy. She served four years of a 26-year sentence before the murder conviction was overturned on October 3, 2011. However, on March 26, 2013, Knox's acquittal was overturned by the Italian Supreme Court, sending the case back to the lower court for reconsideration. Raffaele Sollecito, Knox's boyfriend at the time of the murder, was also found guilty of the murder but had his conviction overturned by an appeal; this decision was likewise reversed on March 26, 2013.</p>
<p>The jury upheld Knox's separate <i>calunnia</i> conviction for falsely implicating bar owner Patrick Lumumba. For this Knox was sentenced to three years in prison, which she had already served, and was ordered to pay Lumumba's court costs of about 22,000 euros. Knox's retrial on the charge of murder began, with Knox herself in absentia, on September 30, 2013. On January 30, 2014 Knox lost the appeal of her conviction at that retrial: the lower court's guilty verdict was affirmed sentencing her to 28 years in prison.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Knox' >More...</a><hr><h2> Murder of Meredith Kercher</h2><p>Meredith Kercher, a British university exchange student from Coulsdon, London, was murdered in Perugia, Italy, on 1 November 2007. Kercher, aged 21, was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. Some of her belongings were missing, including cash, two credit cards, two mobile phones, and her house keys. The alarm had been raised by one of her flatmates, Amanda Knox, who had reported an apparent burglary when she arrived the next morning. Within hours the principal investigator had concluded that signs of a break-in had been staged to mislead the police enquiry, and Knox became the prime suspect. After four days of repeatedly being questioned, Knox was subjected to an all night interrogation during which—in disputed circumstances—she implicated herself and a bar owner she worked for; he was then arrested along with Knox and her boyfriend. The bar owner was released when forensic evidence pointed to Rudy Guede, an Ivory Coast native raised in Perugia. Guede opted for a fast track trial. Under Italian law a guilty verdict is not regarded as a definitive conviction until the accused has exhausted the appeals process, irrespective of the number of times the defendant has been put on trial.  In October 2008 Guede was found guilty of having sexually assaulted and murdered Kercher, he exhausted the appeals process and is currently in prison serving a 16 year sentence.</p>
<p>Knox and her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were accused of murdering Kercher while acting with Guede. Knox and Sollecito were tried together and found guilty at the initial stage of a two-level trials process. They were sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively. In October 2011 they were released after almost four years in prison following their acquittals at the second level trial. In an official statement of their grounds for overturning the convictions the judges wrote there was a "material non-existence" of evidence to support the guilty verdicts, and that an association among Sollecito, Knox and Guede to commit the murder was "far from probable". The murder and subsequent events, especially Knox's arrest and trial, received worldwide press coverage. Some observers criticised the media for not describing the case accurately and dispassionately, as they believed it could influence the court case.<br></p>
<p>Italy's supreme court granted a prosecution appeal, setting aside the judgement of the appellate trial that had acquitted Knox and Sollecito, and ordering them to be retried. Neither was required to attend. On 30 January 2014, the court rendered a guilty verdict for both accused parties. The lawyers for Knox and Sollecito said they plan to appeal.</p>

For practical purposes, travel across the Bering Straits, or the former land bridge in the same region are excluded.</p>
<p>Only one instance of pre-Columbian European contact – the Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, Canada c. 1000 AD – is established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Many further forms of pre-Columbian contact have been proposed, based on historical accounts, archaeological finds, and cultural comparisons. However, most claims of such contact are controversial and debated, due in part to much ambiguous or circumstantial evidence cited by proponents. The scientific responses to pre-Columbian contact claims range from serious consideration in peer-reviewed publications to dismissal as fringe science or pseudoarcheology.</p>

A star must have at least 8 times, and no more than 40–50 times, the mass of the Sun for this type of explosion. It is distinguished from other types of supernovae by the presence of hydrogen in its spectrum. Type II supernovae are mainly observed in the spiral arms of galaxies and in H II regions, but not in elliptical galaxies.</p>
<p>Stars generate energy by the nuclear fusion of elements. Unlike the Sun, massive stars possess the mass needed to fuse elements that have an atomic mass greater than hydrogen and helium, albeit at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures, causing increasingly shorter stellar life spans. The degeneracy pressure of electrons and the energy generated by these fusion reactions are sufficient to counter the force of gravity and prevent the star from collapsing, maintaining stellar equilibrium. The star fuses increasingly higher mass elements, starting with hydrogen and then helium, progressing up through the periodic table until a core of iron and nickel is produced. Fusion of iron or nickel produces no net energy output, so no further fusion can take place, leaving the nickel-iron core inert. Due to the lack of energy output allowing outward pressure, equilibrium is broken.</p>
<p>When the mass of the inert core exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit of about 1.4 solar masses, electron degeneracy alone is no longer sufficient to counter gravity and maintain stellar equilibrium. A cataclysmic implosion takes place within seconds, in which the outer core reaches an inward velocity of up to 23% of the speed of light and the inner core reaches temperatures of up to 100 billion kelvin. Neutrons and neutrinos are formed via reversed beta-decay, releasing about 10<sup>46</sup> joules (100 foes) in a ten-second burst. The collapse is halted by neutron degeneracy, causing the implosion to rebound and bounce outward. The energy of this expanding shock wave is sufficient to accelerate the surrounding stellar material to escape velocity, forming a supernova explosion, while the shock wave and extremely high temperature and pressure briefly allow for the production of elements heavier than iron. Because of the underlying mechanism, the resulting nova is also described as a core-collapse supernova.</p>
<p>There exist several categories of Type II supernova explosions, which are categorized based on the resulting light curve—a graph of luminosity versus time—following the explosion. Type II-L supernovae show a steady (linear) decline of the light curve following the explosion, whereas Type II-P display a period of slower decline (a plateau) in their light curve followed by a normal decay. Type Ib and Ic supernovae are a type of core-collapse supernova for a massive star that has shed its outer envelope of hydrogen and (for Type Ic) helium. As a result, they appear to be lacking in these elements.</p>

<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella' >More...</a><hr><h2> Great Famine (Ireland)</h2><p>In Ireland, the <b>Great Famine</b> was a period of mass starvation, disease and emigration between 1845 and 1852. It is sometimes referred to, mostly outside Ireland, as the <b>Irish Potato Famine</b> because one-third of the population was then solely reliant on this cheap crop for a number of historical reasons. In the Irish language it is called <i>an Gorta Mór</i> (<small>IPA: </small>[ənˠ ˈɡɔɾˠtˠə ˈmˠoːɾˠ], meaning "the Great Hunger") or <i>an Drochshaol</i> ([ənˠ ˈdˠɾɔxˌhiːlˠ], meaning "the bad life"). During the famine approximately 1 million people died and a million more emigrated from Ireland, causing the island's population to fall by between 20% and 25%. The proximate cause of famine was a potato disease commonly known as potato blight.</p>
<p>Although the potato crop failed, the country was still producing and exporting more than enough grain crops to feed the population. Records show during the period Ireland was exporting approximately thirty to fifty shiploads per day of food produce. As a consequence of these exports and a number of other factors such as land acquisition, absentee landlords and the effect of the 1690 penal laws, the Great Famine today is viewed by a number of historical academics as a form of either direct or indirect genocide.</p>
<p>The famine was a watershed in the history of Ireland. Its effects permanently changed the island's demographic, political and cultural landscape. For both the native Irish and those in the resulting diaspora, the famine entered folk memory and became a rallying point for various Home rule and United Ireland movements, as the whole island was then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>The massive famine soured the already strained relations between many of the Irish people and the British Crown, heightening Irish republicanism, which eventually led to Irish independence in the next century. Modern historians regard it as a dividing line in the Irish historical narrative, referring to the preceding period of Irish history as "pre-Famine".</p>
