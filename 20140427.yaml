  title: Women's lacrosse
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Women's lacrosse</b>, sometimes shortened to <b>wlax</b> or <b>lax</b>, is a sport played with twelve players on each team. Originally played by indigenous peoples of the Americas, the modern women's game was introduced in 1890 at the St Leonard's School in Scotland. The rules of women's lacrosse differ significantly from men's field lacrosse.</p>
    <p>The object of the game is to use a long-handled racket (known as a <i>crosse</i> or lacrosse stick) to catch, carry, and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling the ball into an opponent's goal. The head of the lacrosse stick has a mesh net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball. Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body positioning. The rules of women's lacrosse are very complicated, and very different from the men's lacrosse game. Equipment required to play is also different from the men's. Women are only required to wear eyewear/lacrosse goggles, and a mouth guard. Their stick has restrictions too, it has to be a certain length and the pocket cannot be too deep.</p>
    <p>At the collegiate level, lacrosse is represented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. In the United States an NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship is held each spring. Internationally women's lacrosse has a thirty-one member group called the Federation of International Lacrosse, which sponsors the Women's Lacrosse World Cup once every four years.</p>

  title: Acute radiation syndrome
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Acute radiation syndrome</b> (<b>ARS</b>), also known as <b>radiation poisoning</b>, <b>radiation sickness</b> or <b>radiation toxicity</b>, is a constellation of health effects which present within 24 hours of exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation. The radiation causes cellular degradation due to damage to DNA and other key molecular structures within the cells in various tissues; this destruction, particularly as it affects ability of cells to divide normally, in turn causes the symptoms. The symptoms can begin within one or two hours and may last for several months. The terms refer to acute medical problems rather than ones that develop after a prolonged period.</p>
    <p>The onset and type of symptoms depends on the radiation exposure. Relatively smaller doses result in gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting and symptoms related to falling blood counts such as infection and bleeding. Relatively larger doses can result in neurological effects and rapid death. Treatment of acute radiation syndrome is generally supportive with blood transfusions and antibiotics, with some more exotic treatments such as bone marrow transfusions being required in extreme cases.</p>
    <p>Similar symptoms may appear months to years after exposure as chronic radiation syndrome when the dose rate is too low to cause the acute form. Radiation exposure can also increase the probability of developing some other diseases, mainly different types of cancers. These diseases are sometimes referred to as radiation sickness, but they are never included in the term acute radiation syndrome.</p>

These roles, among others, have made him an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.</p>
    <p>For his work in the films <i>Unforgiven</i> (1992) and <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> (2004), Eastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Producer of the Best Picture, as well as receiving nominations for Best Actor. His greatest commercial successes have been <i>Every Which Way But Loose</i> (1978) and its sequel, <i>Any Which Way You Can</i> (1980), after adjustment for inflation. Other popular films include <i>Hang 'Em High</i> (1968), <i>Play Misty for Me</i> (1971), <i>Thunderbolt and Lightfoot</i> (1974), <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i> (1976), <i>Escape from Alcatraz</i> (1979), <i>Firefox</i> (1982), <i>Tightrope</i> (1984), <i>Pale Rider</i> (1985), <i>Heartbreak Ridge</i> (1986), <i>In the Line of Fire</i> (1993), <i>The Bridges of Madison County</i> (1995), and <i>Gran Torino</i> (2008).</p>
    <p>In addition to directing many of his own star vehicles, Eastwood has also directed films in which he did not appear, such as <i>Mystic River</i> (2003) and <i>Letters from Iwo Jima</i> (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, and <i>Changeling</i> (2008). He received considerable critical praise in France, including for several films which were not well received in the United States, and he has been awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994 he became a recipient of the French Republic's Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and in 2007 he was awarded the Légion d'honneur medal. In 2000, he was awarded the Italian Venice Film Festival Golden Lion for lifetime achievement.</p>
    <p>Since 1967, Eastwood has run his own production company, Malpaso, which has produced all except four of his American films. He served as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California from 1986 to 1988. Eastwood has at least seven children by five different women, although he has only married twice.</p>

  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park</b> (German: <i>Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer</i>) is a national park in the Schleswig-Holstein area of the German Wadden Sea. It was founded by the Parliament of Schleswig-Holstein on 1 October 1985 by the National Park Act of 22 July 1985 and expanded significantly in 1999. Together with the Lower Saxon Wadden Sea National Park, the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park and those parts of Elbe estuary which are not nature reserves, it forms the German part of the Wadden Sea.</p>
    <p>The national park extends from the German-Danish maritime border in the north down to the Elbe estuary in the south. In the North Frisian area, it includes the mudflats around the geest-based and marsh islands and the <i>Halligen</i> (undyked islands). There the mudflats are 40 km wide in places. Further south lie areas of mudflats which contain particularly large sandbanks. In addition to the plants and animals that are typical of the entire Wadden Sea, especially large numbers of porpoise, shelduck and eelgrass may be seen in the Schleswig-Holstein part.</p>
    <p>With an area of 4410 km ² it is by far the largest national park in Germany. Some 68% of its area is permanently under water and 30% is periodically dry. The land element consists mainly of salt marshes. Since 1990, the national park, including the North Frisian <i>Halligen</i>, has been designated as a UNESCO recognised biosphere. Together with other German and Dutch Wadden Sea areas it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 26 June 2009.</p>

  title: Zionism
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Zionism</b> (Hebrew: צִיּוֹנוּת, translit. <i>Tsiyonut</i>) is the national movement of Jews and Jewish culture that supports the creation of a Jewish homeland in the territory defined as the Land of Israel. A religious variety of Zionism supports Jews upholding their Jewish identity, opposes the assimilation of Jews into other societies and has advocated the return of Jews to Israel as a means for Jews to be a majority in their own nation, and to be liberated from antisemitic discrimination, exclusion, and persecution that had historically occurred in the diaspora. Zionism emerged in the late 19th century in central and eastern Europe as a national revival movement, and soon after this most leaders of the movement associated the main goal with creating the desired state in Palestine, then an area controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Since the establishment of the State of Israel, the Zionist movement continues primarily to advocate on behalf of the Jewish state and address threats to its continued existence and security. In a less common usage, the term may also refer to non-political, cultural Zionism, founded and represented most prominently by Ahad Ha'am; and political support for the State of Israel by non-Jews, as in Christian Zionism.</p>
    <p>Defenders of Zionism say it is a national liberation movement for the repatriation of a dispersed socio-religious group to what they see as an abandoned homeland millennia before. Critics of Zionism see it as a colonialist or racist ideology that led to the denial of rights, dispossession and expulsion of the "indigenous population of Palestine".</p>

    <p><b>Sikhism</b> (/ˈsiːkɨzəm/ or /ˈsɪkɨzəm/; Punjabi: ਸਿੱਖੀ, <i>sikkhī</i>, <small>IPA: </small>[ˈsɪkːʰiː]) is a monotheistic religion founded during the 15th century in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent, by Guru Nanak and continued to progress through the ten successive Sikh gurus (the eleventh and last guru being the holy scripture <i>Guru Granth Sahib</i>. The Guru Granth Sahib is a collection of the Sikh Gurus' writings that was compiled by the 5th Sikh Guru). It is the fifth-largest organized religion in the world, with approximately 30 million adherents. Punjab, India is the only state in the world with a majority Sikh population.</p>
    <p>Adherents of Sikhism are known as Sikhs (<i>students</i> or <i>disciples</i>). According to Devinder Singh Chahal, "The word 'Sikhi' (commonly known as Gurmat) gave rise to the modern anglicized word 'Sikhism' for the modern world." Gurmat means literally 'wisdom of the Guru' in contrast to <i>Manmat</i>, which means self-willed impulses.</p>
    <p>According to Sewa Singh Kalsi, "The central teaching in Sikhism is the belief in the concept of the oneness of God." Sikhism considers spiritual life and secular life to be intertwined. Guru Nanak, the first Sikh Guru established the system of the Langar (communal kitchen), in order to demonstrate the need to share and have equality between all people. Sikhs also believe that "all religious traditions are equally valid and capable of enlightening their followers". In addition to sharing with others Guru Nanak inspired people to earn an honest living without exploitation and also the need for remembrance of the divine name (God). Guru Nanak described living an "active, creative, and practical life" of "truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity" as being higher than a purely contemplative life. Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru, established the political/temporal (Miri) and spiritual (Piri) realms to be mutually coexistent.</p>
    <p>According to the ninth Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadhur, the ideal Sikh should have both Shakti (power that resides in the temporal), and Bhakti (spiritual meditative qualities). Finally the concept of the baptized Saint Soldier of the Khalsa was formed by the tenth Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh in 1699 at Anandpur Sahib. Sikhs are expected to embody the qualities of a "Sant-Sipāhī"—a saint-soldier. Sikhs are expected to have control over the so-called "Five Thieves", dispelling these by means of the so-called "Five Virtues".</p>
