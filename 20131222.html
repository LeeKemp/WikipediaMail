		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 22 December 2013 </h1><h2> Sodium bicarbonate</h2><p><b>Sodium bicarbonate</b> or <b>sodium hydrogen carbonate</b> is the chemical compound with the formula NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Sodium bicarbonate is a white solid that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder. It has a slightly salty, alkaline taste resembling that of washing soda (sodium carbonate). The natural mineral form is nahcolite. It is a component of the mineral natron and is found dissolved in many mineral springs. It is among the food additives encoded by European Union, identified by the initials E 500. Since it has long been known and is widely used, the salt has many related names such as <b>baking soda</b>, <b>bread soda</b>, <b>cooking soda</b>, and <b>bicarbonate of soda</b>. In colloquial usage, its name is shortened to <b>sodium bicarb</b>, <b>bicarb soda</b>, or simply <b>bicarb</b>. The word <i>saleratus</i>, from Latin <i>sal æratus</i> meaning <i>aerated salt</i>, was widely used in the 19th century for both sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate. The term has now fallen out of common usage.</p>

Large sections of the aircraft crashed into Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 11 more people on the ground.</p>
<p>Following a three-year joint investigation by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, arrest warrants were issued for two Libyan nationals in November 1991. In 1999, Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi eventually handed over the two men for trial at Camp Zeist, Netherlands after protracted negotiations and UN sanctions. In 2001, Libyan intelligence officer, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, was jailed for the bombing. In August 2009, he was released by the Scottish government on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. He died in May 2012, remaining the only person to be convicted for the attack.</p>
<p>In 2003, Gaddafi accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing and paid compensation to the families of the victims, although he maintained never having given the order for the attack. During the Libyan civil war, in 2011, a former government official contradicted Gaddafi claiming that the Libyan leader had personally ordered the bombing. Despite these assertions, numerous conspiracy theories have developed regarding responsibility for the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103.</p>
<p>To date, in the United Kingdom, it remains the deadliest aviation incident, as well as the deadliest act of terrorism.</p>
