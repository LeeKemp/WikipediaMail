Pi Day is observed on March 14 (or 3/14 in the <i>month/day</i> date format), since 3, 1, and 4 are the three most significant digits of π in the decimal form. In 2009, the United States House of Representatives supported the designation of Pi Day.</p>
<p><b>Pi Approximation Day</b> is observed on July 22 (or 22/7 in the <i>day/month</i> date format), since the fraction <sup>22</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub> is a common approximation of π.</p>

He is known for the motto "any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed." </p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Churchill' >More...</a><hr><h2> Bill Nye</h2><p><b>William Sanford "Bill" Nye</b> (born November 27, 1955), popularly known as <b>Bill Nye the Science Guy</b>, is an American science educator, comedian, television host, actor, writer, and scientist who began his career as a mechanical engineer at Boeing. He is best known as the host of the Disney/PBS children's science show <i>Bill Nye the Science Guy</i> (1993–98) and for his many subsequent appearances in popular media as a science educator.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nye' >More...</a><hr><h2> Caligula</h2><p>"<b>Caligula</b>" (Latin: <i>Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus</i>;) was the popular nickname of <b>Gaius</b> (31 August 12 AD – 22 January 41 AD), Roman emperor from 37 AD to 41 AD. Caligula was a member of the house of rulers conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Caligula's father Germanicus, the nephew and adopted son of Emperor Tiberius, was a very successful general and one of Rome's most beloved public figures. The young Gaius earned the nickname Caligula (meaning "little soldier's boot", the diminutive form of <i>caliga</i>, hob-nailed military boot) from his father's soldiers while accompanying him during his campaigns in Germania.</p>
<p>When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19 AD, his wife Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with her six children where she became entangled in an increasingly bitter feud with Tiberius. This conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. Unscathed by the deadly intrigues, Caligula accepted the invitation to join the emperor on the island of Capri in 31 AD, where Tiberius himself had withdrawn five years earlier. With the death of Tiberius in 37 AD, Caligula succeeded his great uncle and adoptive grandfather.</p>
<p>There are few surviving sources on Caligula's reign, although he is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first six months of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and intense sexual perversity, presenting him as an insane tyrant. While the reliability of these sources has increasingly been called into question, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor (as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate). He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and notoriously luxurious dwellings for himself. However, he initiated the construction of two new aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the Empire annexed the Kingdom of Mauretania and made it into a province.</p>
<p>In early 41 AD, Caligula became the first Roman emperor to be assassinated, the result of a conspiracy involving officers of the Praetorian Guard, as well as members of the Roman Senate and of the imperial court. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted: on the same day the Praetorian Guard declared Caligula's uncle Claudius emperor in his place.</p>

It was marked by several religious observances, and became notorious as the date of the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. The death of Caesar made the Ides of March a turning point in Roman history, as one of the events that marked the transition from the historical period known as the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Although March <i>(Martius)</i> was the third month of the Julian calendar, in the oldest Roman calendar it was the first month of the year. The holidays observed by the Romans from the first through the Ides often reflect their origin as new year celebrations.</p>
