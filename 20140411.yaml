  title: Hannah Montana
  extract: |-
    <p><i><b>Hannah Montana</b></i>, also known as <i><b>Hannah Montana Forever</b></i> for the fourth season, is an American musical comedy series created by Michael Poryes, Rich Correll, and Barry O'Brien which focused on Miley Stewart (portrayed by Miley Cyrus), a teenager living a double life as an average schoolgirl by day and a famous recording artist Hannah Montana by night. It follows the day-to-day life of Miley, her brother and friends while also starring Cyrus' country singer father Billy Ray Cyrus as her dad.</p>
    <p>The series, produced by It's a Laugh Productions and Michael Poryes Productions, premiered on Disney Channel on March 24, 2006 and concluded on January 16, 2011 after airing four seasons and ninety-eight episodes. The soundtrack albums <i>Hannah Montana</i> (2006), <i>Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus</i> (2007), <i>Hannah Montana 3</i> (2009), and <i>Hannah Montana Forever</i> (2010) were released to coincide with their respective seasons. In 2007, the series' success led to the Best of Both Worlds Tour, which visited North America. The following year, it was adapted into the 3D film <i>Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert</i> and its accompanying <i>soundtrack</i>. In 2009, the series' first feature film <i>Hannah Montana: The Movie</i> was released to commercial success, and was additionally promoted through its accompanying soundtrack. The show has additionally distributed all seasons to DVD.</p>
    <p>The series received generally favorable reviews from critics, and has been recognized as a "guilty pleasure" by several media outlets. The show's instant success is widely credited with the launch of Cyrus' career and her establishment as a teen idol. However, as she continued to develop an increasingly provocative image as the series progressed, the series has received criticism for appearing to be a negative influence on its younger audience.</p>

    <p><b>Percy Lavon Julian</b> (April 11, 1899 – April 19, 1975) was a U.S. research chemist and a pioneer in the chemical synthesis of medicinal drugs from plants. He was the first to synthesize the natural product physostigmine, and a pioneer in the industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones progesterone and testosterone from plant sterols such as stigmasterol and sitosterol. His work laid the foundation for the steroid drug industry's production of cortisone, other corticosteroids, and birth control pills.</p>
    <p>He later started his own company to synthesize steroid intermediates from the Mexican wild yam. His work helped greatly reduce the cost of steroid intermediates to large multinational pharmaceutical companies, helping to significantly expand the use of several important drugs.</p>
    <p>Julian received more than 130 chemical patents. He was one of the first African-Americans to receive a doctorate in chemistry. He was the first African-American chemist inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the second African-American scientist inducted from any field.</p>

    <p><b>Java</b> (Indonesian: <i><b>Jawa</b></i>; Javanese: ꦗꦮ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population roughly equal to Russia as of 2014, (excluding the 3.7 million on the island of Madura which is administered as part of the province of East Java), Java is the world's most populous island, and one of the most densely populated places in the world. Java is the home of 57 percent of the Indonesian population. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 40s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.</p>
    <p>Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions, Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in Indonesia. A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east-west spine along the island. It has three main languages, with Javanese being the dominant language; it is the native language of about 60 million people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java. Most of its residents are bilingual, with Indonesian as their first or second languages. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java has a diverse mixture of religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.</p>
    <p>Java is divided into four provinces, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Banten, and also two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.</p>

  title: Tesseract
  extract: |-
    <p>In geometry, the <b>tesseract</b>, also called an <b>8-cell</b> or <b>regular octachoron</b> or <b>cubic prism</b>, is the four-dimensional analog of the cube; the tesseract is to the cube as the cube is to the square. Just as the surface of the cube consists of 6 square faces, the hypersurface of the tesseract consists of 8 cubical cells. The tesseract is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes.</p>
    <p>A generalization of the cube to dimensions greater than three is called a "hypercube", "<i>n</i>-cube" or "measure polytope". The tesseract is the <b>four-dimensional hypercube</b>, or <b>4-cube</b>.</p>
    <p>According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the word <i>tesseract</i> was coined and first used in 1888 by Charles Howard Hinton in his book <i>A New Era of Thought</i>, from the Greek τέσσερεις ακτίνες ("four rays"), referring to the four lines from each vertex to other vertices. In this publication, as well as some of Hinton's later work, the word was occasionally spelled "tessaract." Some people<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> have called the same figure a <b>tetracube</b>, and also simply a <b>hypercube</b> (although a <i>tetracube</i> can also mean a polycube made of four cubes, and the term <i>hypercube</i> is also used with dimensions greater than 4).</p>

  title: Climatic Research Unit email controversy
  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>Climatic Research Unit email controversy</b> (also known as <b>"Climategate"</b>) began in November 2009 with the hacking of a server at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) by an external attacker. Several weeks before the Copenhagen Summit on climate change, an unknown individual or group breached CRU's server and copied thousands of emails and computer files to various locations on the Internet.</p>
    <p>The story was first broken by climate change critics on their blogs, with columnist James Delingpole popularising the term "Climategate" to describe the controversy. Climate change critics and others denying the significance of human caused climate change argued that the emails showed that global warming was a scientific conspiracy, in which they alleged that scientists manipulated climate data and attempted to suppress critics. The accusations were rejected by the CRU, who said that the emails had been taken out of context and merely reflected an honest exchange of ideas.</p>
    <p>The mainstream media picked up the story as negotiations over climate change mitigation began in Copenhagen on 7 December. Because of the timing, scientists, policy makers, and public relations experts said that the release of emails was a smear campaign intended to undermine the climate conference. In response to the controversy, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released statements supporting the scientific consensus that the Earth's mean surface temperature had been rising for decades, with the AAAS concluding "based on multiple lines of scientific evidence that global climate change caused by human activities is now underway...it is a growing threat to society."</p>
    <p>Eight committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. However, the reports called on the scientists to avoid any such allegations in the future by taking steps to regain public confidence in their work, for example by opening up access to their supporting data, processing methods and software, and by promptly honouring freedom of information requests. The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged throughout the investigations.</p>

  title: Methanesulfonic acid
  extract: |
    <p><b>Methanesulfonic acid</b> is a colorless liquid with the chemical formula CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H. It is the simplest of the alkylsulfonic acids. Salts and esters of methanesulfonic acid are known as mesylates. Methanesulfonic acid is used as an acid catalyst in organic reactions because it is a non-volatile, strong acid that is soluble in organic solvents. Methanesulfonic acid is convenient for industrial applications because it is liquid at ambient temperature, while the closely related <i>p</i>-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) is solid. However, in a laboratory setting, solid PTSA is more convenient.</p>
    <p>Methanesulfonic acid may be considered an intermediate compound between sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), and methylsulfonylmethane ((CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>), effectively replacing an -OH group with a -CH<sub>3</sub> group at each step. This pattern can extend no further in either direction without breaking down the -SO<sub>2</sub> group.</p>
    <p>Methanesulfonic acid can be used in the generation of borane (BH<sub>3</sub>). By reacting methanesulfonic acid with NaBH<sub>4</sub> in an aprotic solvent such as THF or DMS, the complex of BH<sub>3</sub> and the solvent is formed.</p>

  title: Tickling
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Tickling</b> is the act of touching a part of the body so as to cause involuntary twitching movements and/or laughter. The word  "tickle"  evolved from the Middle English <i>tikelen</i>, perhaps frequentative of <i>ticken</i>, to touch lightly. The idiom <i>tickled pink</i> means to be pleased or delighted.</p>
    <p>In 1897, psychologists G. Stanley Hall and Arthur Allin described a "tickle" as two different types of phenomena. One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type of tickle, called a knismesis, generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation. Another type of tickle is the laughter inducing "heavy" tickle, produced by repeatedly applying pressure to "ticklish" areas, and is known as gargalesis. Such sensations can be pleasurable or exciting, but are sometimes considered highly unpleasant, particularly in the case of relentless heavy tickling.</p>
    <p>The question as to why a person could not tickle him/herself was raised by the Greek philosopher, Aristotle.</p>
    <p>Francis Bacon and Charles Darwin believe that humorous laughter requires a "light" frame of mind. But they differed on ticklish laughter: Darwin thought that the same light state of mind was required, whereas Bacon said no: When tickled, noted Bacon, "men even in a grieved state of mind, yet cannot sometimes forbear laughing."</p>

  title: Lilith
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Lilith</b> (Hebrew: לילית‎; <i>lilit</i>, or <i>lilith</i>) is a Hebrew name for a figure in Jewish mythology, developed earliest in the Babylonian Talmud, who is generally thought to be in part derived from a class of female demons <i>Līlīṯu</i> in Mesopotamian texts of Assyria and Babylonia.</p>
    <p>Evidence in later Jewish materials is plentiful, but little information has been found relating to the original Akkadian and Babylonian view of these demons. The relevance of two sources previously used to connect the Jewish Lilith to an Akkadian Lilitu—the Gilgamesh appendix and the Arslan Tash amulets—are now both disputed by recent scholarship. The two problematic sources are discussed below.</p>
    <p>The Hebrew term <i>Lilith</i> or "Lilit" (translated as "Night creatures", "night monster", "night hag", or "screech owl") first occurs in Isaiah 34:14, either singular or plural according to variations in the earliest manuscripts, though in a list of animals. In the Dead Sea Scrolls <i>Songs of the Sage</i> the term first occurs in a list of monsters. In Jewish magical inscriptions on bowls and amulets from the 6th century CE onwards, Lilith is identified as a female demon and the first visual depictions appear.</p>
    <p>In Jewish folklore, from the 8th–10th century <i>Alphabet of Ben Sira</i> onwards, Lilith becomes Adam's first wife, who was created at the same time (Rosh Hashanah) and from the same earth as Adam. This contrasts with Eve, who was created from one of Adam's ribs. The legend was greatly developed during the Middle Ages, in the tradition of Aggadic midrashim, the Zohar, and Jewish mysticism. In the 13th century writings of Rabbi Isaac ben Jacob ha-Cohen, for example, Lilith left Adam after she refused to become subservient to him and then would not return to the Garden of Eden after she mated with archangel Samael. The resulting Lilith legend is still commonly used as source material in modern Western culture, literature, occultism, fantasy, and horror.</p>
