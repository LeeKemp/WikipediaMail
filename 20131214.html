Administered by the Military District of Washington (MDW), state funerals are greatly influenced by protocol, steeped in tradition, and rich in history. However, the overall planning as well as the decision to hold a state funeral, is largely determined by the president before his death and the First Family.</p>

It was developed by Pyra Labs, which was bought by Google in 2003. Generally, the blogs are hosted by Google at a subdomain of <b>blogspot.com</b>. Up until May 1, 2010 Blogger allowed users to publish blogs on other hosts, via FTP. All such blogs had (or still have) to be moved to Google's own servers, with domains other than blogspot.com allowed via custom URLs. Unlike Wordpress, Blogger cannot be installed in a web server. One has to use DNS facilities to redirect a blogspot domain to a custom URL.</p>

He is often regarded as the greatest, most celebrated, and most powerful pharaoh of the Egyptian Empire. His successors and later Egyptians called him the "Great Ancestor". Ramesses II led several military expeditions into the Levant, reasserting Egyptian control over Canaan. He also led expeditions to the south, into Nubia, commemorated in inscriptions at Beit el-Wali and Gerf Hussein.</p>
<p>At age fourteen, Ramesses was appointed Prince Regent by his father Seti I. He is believed to have taken the throne in his late teens and is known to have ruled Egypt from 1279 BC to 1213 BC for 66 years and 2 months, according to both Manetho and Egypt's contemporary historical records. He was once said to have lived to be 99 years old, but it is more likely that he died in his 90th or 91st year. If he became Pharaoh in 1279 BC as most Egyptologists today believe, he would have assumed the throne on May 31, 1279 BC, based on his known accession date of III Shemu day 27. Ramesses II celebrated an unprecedented 14 sed festivals (the first held after thirty years of a pharaoh's reign, and then every three years) during his reign—more than any other pharaoh. On his death, he was buried in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings; his body was later moved to a royal cache where it was discovered in 1881, and is now on display in the Cairo Museum.</p>
<p>The early part of his reign was focused on building cities, temples and monuments. He established the city of Pi-Ramesses in the Nile Delta as his new capital and main base for his campaigns in Syria. This city was built on the remains of the city of Avaris, the capital of the Hyksos when they took over, and was the location of the main Temple of Set. He is also known as <b>Ozymandias</b> in the Greek sources, from a transliteration into Greek of a part of Ramesses' throne name, <i>Usermaatre Setepenre</i>, "Ra's mighty truth, chosen of Ra".</p>

He was married to Kim Kyong-hui, aunt of Kim Jong-un, the supreme leader of North Korea.</p>
<p>Although the precise extent of Jang Sung-taek's power and position cannot be confirmed, in 2008 South Korean government officials and academic North Korea specialists suggested that he may have taken on <i>de facto</i> leadership over North Korea due to Kim Jong-il's ailing health, and later death. Jang was vice-chairman of the National Defence Commission, a position considered second only to that of the Supreme Leader. It is believed he was promoted to four-star general around the time of Kim Jong-il's death as his first appearance in uniform was while visiting Kim lying in state. Jang was termed as Kim Jong-un's "key policy adviser".</p>
<p>In December 2013, he was abruptly accused of being a counter-revolutionary, stripped of all his posts and expelled from the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). <i>Damnatio memoriae</i> was applied, with his photos retroactively removed from official media and his image digitally removed from photos with other Korean leaders. On 13 December, North Korea state media announced he had been executed.</p>

He starred as high school principal Steven Harper on the series <i>Boston Public</i>, as Emerson Cod on <i>Pushing Daisies</i>, as Detective Laverne Winston on the Fox drama <i>Human Target</i>, and more recently as Detective Don Owen in the short-lived CBS crime drama <i>Golden Boy</i>.

Before driving to the school, Lanza shot and killed his mother Nancy at their Newtown home. As first responders arrived, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head.</p>
<p>It was the second deadliest mass shooting by a single person in American history, after the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, and the second deadliest mass murder at a U.S. elementary school, after the 1927 Bath School bombings in Michigan.</p>
<p>The incident prompted renewed debate about gun control in the United States, and a proposal for new legislation banning the sale and manufacture of certain types of semi-automatic firearms and magazines with more than ten rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p>A November 2013 report issued by the Connecticut State Attorney's office concluded that the perpetrator acted alone and planned his actions, but no evidence collected provided any indication as to why he did so, or why he targeted Sandy Hook Elementary School.</p>
