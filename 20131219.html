		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 19 December 2013 </h1><h2> Daniel Patterson (chef)</h2><p><b>Daniel Patterson</b> is an American chef, restaurateur, and food writer, considered a leading proponent of California cuisine.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Patterson_(chef)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Al Capone</h2><p><b>Alphonse Gabriel “Al” Capone</b> (/æl kəˈpoʊn/; January 17, 1899 – January 25, 1947) was an American gangster who led a Prohibition-era crime syndicate. The Chicago Outfit, which subsequently also became known as the “Capones”, was dedicated to smuggling and bootlegging liquor, and other illegal activities, such as prostitution, in Chicago from the early 1920s to 1931.</p>
<p>Born in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City to Italian immigrants, Capone became involved with gang activity at a young age after having been expelled from school at age 14. In his early twenties, he moved to Chicago to take advantage of a new opportunity to make money smuggling illegal alcoholic beverages into the city during Prohibition. He also engaged in various other criminal activities, including bribery of government figures and prostitution.</p>
<p>Despite his illegitimate occupation, Capone became a highly visible public figure. He made donations to various charitable endeavors using the money he made from his activities, and was viewed by many to be a “modern-day Robin Hood”. Capone’s public reputation was damaged in the wake of his supposed involvement in the 1929 Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre, when seven rival gang members were executed.</p>
<p>Capone was convicted on federal charges of tax evasion in 1931 and sentenced to federal prison; he was released on parole in 1939. His incarceration included a term at the then-new Alcatraz federal prison. In the final years of Capone’s life, he suffered mental and physical deterioration due to late-stage neurosyphilis, which he had contracted in his youth. On January 25, 1947, he died from cardiac arrest after suffering a stroke.</p>

<p>After tampering with line signals, a 15-strong gang of robbers led by Bruce Reynolds attacked the train. Other gang members included Gordon Goody, Buster Edwards, Charlie Wilson, Roy James, John Daly, Jimmy White, Ronnie Biggs, Tommy Wisbey, Jim Hussey, Bob Welch and Roger Courdrey as well as three men known only as numbers '1', '2' and '3'. A 16th man, an unnamed retired train driver, was also present at the time of robbery.</p>
<p>With careful planning based on inside information from an individual known only as 'The Ulsterman', the robbers got away with over £2.6 million (the equivalent of £46 million today). The bulk of the stolen money was never recovered. Though the gang did not use any firearms, Jack Mills, the train driver, was beaten over the head with a metal bar. Mills' injuries were severe enough to end his career.</p>
<p>After the robbery the gang hid at Leatherslade Farm. It was after the police found this hideout that incriminating evidence would lead to the eventual arrest and conviction of most of the gang. The ringleaders were handed 30-year jail sentences.</p>

The lake fills Taal Caldera, a large volcanic caldera formed by very large eruptions between 500,000 and 100,000 years ago. It is the country's third largest lake after Laguna de Bay and Lake Lanao. Volcano Island, the location of Taal Volcano's historical eruptions and responsible for the lake's sulfuric content, lies near the center of the lake. There is a crater lake on Volcano Island, which is the world's largest lake on an island (Volcano Island) in a lake (Taal Lake) on an island (Luzon). Known as the Main Crater Lake, it contains its own small island, Vulcan Point.</p>

He is best known as a founding member and the lead vocalist and lyricist of the alternative rock band Lostprophets. Lostprophets disbanded in 2013 after Watkins was charged with sexual offences in late 2012. In November 2013, Watkins pleaded guilty to 13 charges, including the attempted rape and sexual assault of a child under 13. He was subsequently sentenced to 29 years imprisonment and six years on extended licence.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Watkins_(Lostprophets)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Lostprophets</h2><p><b>Lostprophets</b> /lɒstˈprɒfɪts/ were a Welsh rock band from Pontypridd, formed in 1997. Founded by their lead vocalist Ian Watkins, bassist (later guitarist) Mike Lewis, drummer Mike Chiplin and guitarist Lee Gaze, they were originally a side-project to hardcore punk band Public Disturbance. Lostprophets released five studio albums, with their final release <i>Weapons</i> being released on 2 April 2012. They were also part of the Cardiff music scene.</p>
<p>The band achieved two top ten hits on the UK Singles Chart ("Last Train Home" and "Rooftops"), one number one single on the Alternative Songs chart ("Last Train Home"), several Kerrang! Awards and nominations, and sold around 3.5 million albums worldwide. However, in late 2012, Watkins was charged with multiple sexual offences against children. The band cancelled all tour dates and their future remained uncertain until the other members announced the breakup of Lostprophets in October 2013; Watkins pleaded guilty to several (but not all) charges in November 2013, and in December 2013, was sentenced to 29 years' imprisonment plus 6 years on licence.</p>
