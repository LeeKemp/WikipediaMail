		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 26 April 2014 </h1><h2> Tito Vilanova</h2><p><b>Francesc "Tito" Vilanova i Bayó</b> (17 September 1968 – 25 April 2014) was a Spanish manager and footballer who played as a central midfielder.</p>
<p>After a professional playing career which culminated in three seasons in La Liga, where he played 26 games in three seasons for Celta de Vigo, Vilanova went on to work with Barcelona as an assistant coach under Pep Guardiola, being part of the squads that won 14 titles.</p>
<p>In 2012 Vilanova was appointed first-team manager, winning the La Liga title in his first season. He stepped down in July 2013, due to ill health. He died of cancer 10 months later on 25 April 2014.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Vilanova' >More...</a><hr><h2> LGBT rights in Sweden</h2><p><b>Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender</b> (<b>LGBT</b>) <b>rights</b> in <b>Sweden</b> have been regarded as some of the most progressive in Europe and in the world. Same-sex sexual activity was legalized in 1944 and the age of consent was equalized in 1972. Homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness in 1979. Sweden also became the first country in the world to allow transsexuals to change their legal gender post-sex reassignment surgery in 1972 whilst transvestism was declassified as an illness. Transvestism was eventually declassified as a mental illness in 2008 and a law allowing transsexuals to change their legal gender without sex reassignment surgery was passed in 2013. After allowing same-sex couples to register for partnership benefits in 1995, Sweden became the seventh country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage countrywide in 2009. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity and expression has been banned since 1987. Also, since 2003, gay and lesbian couples can adopt children, and lesbian couples have had equal access to IVF and assisted insemination since 2005. Sweden has been recognized as one of the most socially liberal countries in Europe and in the world, with recent polls indicating that a large majority of Swedes support LGBT rights.</p>

A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred preserving the property.</p>
<p>The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it. Of the more than one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually. The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts. Each year approximately 30,000 properties are added to the National Register as part of districts or by individual listings.</p>
<p>For most of its history the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, coordinate, identify, and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties. Protection of the property is not guaranteed. During the nomination process, the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians.</p>
<p>Occasionally historic sites outside the country proper, but associated with the United States (such as the American Embassy in Tangiers) are also listed. Properties can be nominated in a variety of forms, including individual properties, historic districts, and multiple property submissions (MPS). The Register categorizes general listings into one of five types of properties: district, site, structure, building, or object. <b>National Register Historic Districts</b> are defined geographical areas consisting of contributing and non-contributing properties. Some properties are added automatically to the National Register when they become administered by the National Park Service. These include National Historic Landmarks (NHL), National Historic Sites (NHS), National Historical Parks, National Military Parks/Battlefields, National Memorials, and some National Monuments. (Federal properties can be proclaimed National Monuments under the Antiquities Act because of either their historical or natural significance. They are managed by multiple agencies. Only monuments that are historic in character and managed by the National Park Service are listed administratively in the National Register.)</p>
<p>Some examples are Fallingwater, Robie House, Martin Luther King Jr's Grave, and Old Slater Mill.</p>

Her circumstances are recorded prominently in the annals of abnormal child psychology. Born in Arcadia, California, United States, Genie's father kept her locked alone in a room from the age of 20 months to 13 years, 7 months, almost always strapped to a child's toilet or bound in a crib with her arms and legs completely immobilized. During this time she was never exposed to any significant amount of speech, and as a result she did not acquire a first language during childhood. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles child welfare authorities on November 4, 1970.</p>
<p>In the first several years after Genie's life and circumstances came to light, psychologists, linguists and other scientists focused a great deal of attention on Genie's case, seeing in her near-total isolation an opportunity to study many aspects of human development. Upon finding that she had not yet learned a language, linguists saw Genie as potentially being an important way to gain further insight into the processes controlling language acquisition skills and linguistic development. Extensive observation of their new-found human subject enabled them to publish multiple academic works testing theories and hypotheses identifying critical periods during which humans learn to understand and use language.</p>
<p>After being found Genie was initially cared for at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and her subsequent placements eventually gave rise to rancorous debate. After approximately eight months at Children's Hospital she was moved to one foster home for a month and a half, which proved to be the first of several moves. Upon removal from this home she was then placed with the scientist who was heading the research team studying her, where she lived for approximately four years and where most of the testing and research on her was conducted. In mid-1975, soon after turning 18, she went back to live with her mother, who could not adequately care for her. After a few months she was then placed in a series of at least six institutions for disabled adults, where she experienced further extreme physical and emotional abuse. Cut off from almost all of the people who had studied her, her newly acquired language and behavioral skills rapidly regressed.</p>
<p>After early 1978 Genie's mother decided to forbid all of the scientists except for one from having contact with Genie, and all testing and observations on her ceased. Although psychologists and linguists have continued to write about Genie's development long after the time she was being studied, no scientific analysis of Genie after 1977 has occurred. The only post-1977 updates on Genie and her whereabouts are personal observations or secondary accounts of them, and all are spaced several years apart. As of 2008<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup>, ABC News reported that Genie was living in California, "in psychological confinement as a ward of the state—her sixth foster home. And again, she is speechless."</p>
<p>Genie's case has been extensively compared with that of Victor of Aveyron, an eighteenth-century French child who similarly became a classic case of late language acquisition and delayed development.</p>
