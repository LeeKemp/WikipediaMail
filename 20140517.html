		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 17 May 2014 </h1><h2> Thom Hartmann</h2><p><b>Thomas Carl "Thom" Hartmann</b> (born May 7, 1951) is an American radio host, author, former psychotherapist, entrepreneur, and liberal political commentator. His nationally syndicated radio show, <i>The Thom Hartmann Program</i>, began in March 2003, and airs in the United States. It has 2.75 million listeners a week, and is one of the top progressive talk radio programs.</p>
<p>Hartmann's 2002 article, "Talking Back To Talk Radio", became part of the original business plan of Air America Radio, and he started his radio program out of his home in Vermont in March 2003. He moved to the network on February 19, 2007. On March 1, 2009, Hartmann moved syndication of his show to the former Jones Network, now owned by Dial Global. The radio show is also broadcast on community/non-profit stations via Pacifica Radio and Free Speech TV. In 2008 Hartmann started a daily TV show, <i>The Big Picture.</i> The show began on Free Speech TV, and has also been shown on the RT news network since <i>2012.</i></p>
<p>Several businesses have been founded by Hartmann: The Woodley Herber Company, International Wholesale Travel, its subsidiary Sprayberry Travel, American Marketing Centers, and the Newsletter Factory. The non-profit welfare organization New England Salem Children's Village was started by him.</p>
<p>Hartmann has written many books on political topics and ADHD. He is the originator of the hunter vs. farmer theory of the condition.</p>

She has hosted morning television shows <i>Today</i> and <i>The View</i>, the television news magazine <i>20/20</i>, co-anchored the <i>ABC Evening News</i>, and was a contributor to ABC News.</p>
<p>Walters first became known as a television personality when she was a writer and segment producer of "women's interest stories" on the morning NBC News program <i>The Today Show</i>, where she began work with host Hugh Downs in 1962, once even modeling a swimsuit when an expected model did not show up. Because of her excellent interviewing ability and her popularity with the viewers, and when other women left the program, she was eventually allowed more air time. Even though her production duties made her a significant contributor to the show, she had no input in choosing a successor for Hugh Downs when he left the show in 1971. Frank McGee was hired. Although his salary was twice hers, at Frank McGee's death in 1974, because of a clause added to her contract by her agent (a family friend), she acquired the title "co-host", the first woman by that title for any network news or public affairs program. Jim Hartz became her co-host. Two years later, continuing as a pioneer for women, she became the first female co-anchor of any network evening news, working with Harry Reasoner on the ABC News flagship program <i>ABC Evening News</i> (List of ABC Evening News anchors).</p>
<p>From 1979 to 2004, Walters worked as co-host and producer for the ABC newsmagazine <i>20/20</i>, again appearing with Hugh Downs. From 1976 to 2010, she contributed as an anchor, reporter, and correspondent for ABC News, along with producing and hosting her own special interview programs several times yearly. Beginning in 1997, she has created, and appears as co-host on, <i>The View</i>. Walters retired from ABC News and as co-host of <i>The View</i> on May 16, 2014.</p>
<p>In 1996, Walters was ranked #34 on the <i>TV Guide</i> "50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time".</p>

<p>The original population was destroyed on 10 June 1944, when 642 of its inhabitants, including women and children, were massacred by a German Waffen-SS company. A new village was built after the war on a nearby site but on the orders of the then French president, Charles de Gaulle, the original has been maintained as a permanent memorial and museum.</p>

It was written by Ramis and Danny Rubin, based on a story by Rubin.</p>
<p>Murray plays Phil Connors, an arrogant and egocentric Pittsburgh TV weatherman who, during a heated assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day again and again. After indulging in hedonism and numerous suicide attempts, he begins to re-examine his life and priorities.</p>
<p>In 2006, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".</p>

Starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine, the film features a team of space travelers who travel through a wormhole. Nolan combined his idea with an existing script by his brother Jonathan Nolan that was developed in 2007 for Paramount Pictures and producer Lynda Obst. Nolan is producing the film with Obst and Emma Thomas.</p>
<p>Warner Bros., who produced and distributed Nolan's previous films, negotiated with Paramount, traditionally a rival studio, to have a financial stake in <i>Interstellar</i>. Legendary Pictures, which formerly partnered with Warner Bros., also sought a stake. The three studios co-financed the film, and the production companies Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions were enlisted. The director also hired cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema since his previous collaborator Wally Pfister was busy working on <i>Transcendence</i>, his directorial debut. <i>Interstellar</i> is being filmed with a combination of anamorphic 35mm and IMAX film photography. Filming took place in the last quarter of 2013 in locations in the province of Alberta, Canada, in southern Iceland, and in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p><i>Interstellar</i> is scheduled to be released on November 7, 2014. Paramount will distribute the film in the United States, and Warner Bros. will distribute the film in other territories.</p>

Viruses often perform some type of harmful activity on infected hosts, such as stealing hard disk space or CPU time, accessing private information, corrupting data, displaying political or humorous messages on the user's screen, spamming their contacts, or logging their keystrokes. However, not all viruses carry a destructive payload or attempt to hide themselvesâ€”the defining characteristic of viruses is that they are self-replicating computer programs which install themselves without the user's consent.</p>
<p>Virus writers use social engineering and exploit detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities to gain access to their hosts' computing resources. The vast majority of viruses target systems running Microsoft Windows, employing a variety of mechanisms to infect new hosts, and often using complex anti-detection/stealth strategies to evade antivirus software. Motives for creating viruses can include seeking profit, desire to send a political message, personal amusement, to demonstrate that a vulnerability exists in software, for sabotage and denial of service, or simply because they wish to explore artificial life and evolutionary algorithms.</p>
<p>Computer viruses currently cause billions of dollars worth of economic damage each year, due to causing systems failure, wasting computer resources, corrupting data, increasing maintenance costs, etc. In response, free, open-source antivirus tools have been developed, and a multi-billion dollar industry of antivirus software vendors has cropped up, selling virus protection to Windows users. Unfortunately, no currently existing antivirus software is able to catch all computer viruses (especially new ones); computer security researchers are actively searching for new ways to enable antivirus solutions to more effectively detect emerging viruses, before they have already become widely distributed.</p>
