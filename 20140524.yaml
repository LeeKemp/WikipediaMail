  title: Bonnie and Clyde
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Bonnie Elizabeth Parker</b> (October 1, 1910 – May 23, 1934) and <b>Clyde Chestnut Barrow</b> (March 24, 1909 – May 23, 1934) were American outlaws and robbers from the Dallas area who traveled the central United States with their gang during the Great Depression. At times, the gang included Buck Barrow, Blanche Barrow, Raymond Hamilton, W. D. Jones, Joe Palmer, Ralph Fults, and Henry Methvin. Their exploits captured the attention of the American public during the "public enemy era" between 1931 and 1934. Though known today for his dozen-or-so bank robberies, Barrow preferred to rob small stores or rural gas stations. The gang is believed to have killed at least nine police officers and several civilians. The couple were eventually ambushed and killed in Bienville Parish, Louisiana, by law officers. Their reputation was revived and cemented in American pop folklore by Arthur Penn's 1967 film <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>, which starred Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty as the pair.</p>
    <p>Even during their lifetimes, the couple's depiction in the press was at considerable odds with the hardscrabble reality of their life on the road—particularly in the case of Parker. Though she was present at a hundred or more felonies during her two years as Barrow's companion, she was not the machine gun-wielding killer portrayed in the newspapers, newsreels, and pulp detective magazines of the day. Gang member W.D. Jones later testified that he was unsure whether he had ever seen her fire at officers. Parker's reputation as a cigar-smoking gun moll grew out of a playful snapshot found by police at an abandoned hideout, released to the press, and published nationwide. While she did chain smoke Camel cigarettes, she was not a cigar smoker.</p>
    <p>Historian Jeff Guinn has said that the hideout photos led to the glamorization and creation of legend about the outlaws:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"John Dillinger had matinee-idol good looks and Pretty Boy Floyd had the best possible nickname, but the Joplin photos introduced new criminal superstars with the most titillating trademark of all—illicit sex. Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker were wild and young, and undoubtedly slept together."</p>

  title: Memorial Day
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Memorial Day</b> is a US federal holiday wherein the men and women who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces are remembered. The holiday, which is celebrated every year on the final Monday of May, was formerly known as <b>Decoration Day</b> and originated after the American Civil War to commemorate the Union and Confederate soldiers who died in the Civil War. By the 20th century, Memorial Day had been extended to honor all Americans who have died while in the military service. It typically marks the start of the summer vacation season, while Labor Day marks its end.</p>
    <p>Many people visit cemeteries and memorials, particularly to honor those who have died in military service. Many volunteers place an American flag on each grave in national cemeteries.</p>
    <p>Annual Decoration Days for particular cemeteries are held on a Sunday in late spring or early summer in some rural areas of the American South, notably in the mountains. In cases involving a family graveyard where remote ancestors as well as those who were deceased more recently are buried, this may take on the character of an extended family reunion to which some people travel hundreds of miles. People gather on the designated day and put flowers on graves and renew contacts with kinfolk and others. There often is a religious service and a "dinner on the ground," the traditional term for a potluck meal in which people used to spread the dishes out on sheets or tablecloths on the grass. It is believed that this practice began before the American Civil War and thus may reflect the real origin of the "memorial day" idea.</p>
    <p>Memorial Day is not to be confused with Veterans Day; Memorial Day is a day of remembering the men and women who died while serving, while Veterans Day celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans.</p>

  title: Mass Effect
  extract: |-
    <p><i><b>Mass Effect</b></i> is a series of science fiction action role-playing third person shooter video games developed by the Canadian company BioWare and released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows, with the third installment also released on the Wii U. The trilogy largely revolves around a soldier by the name of Commander Shepard, whose mission is to save the galaxy from a race of powerful mechanical beings known as the Reapers and their agents, including antagonist Saren Arterius. The first game sees Shepard investigating Saren, whom he slowly comes to understand is operating under the guidance of Sovereign, a Reaper left behind in the Milky Way tens of thousands of years previous when the Reapers exterminated virtually all sentient organic life in the galaxy as part of a recurrent cycle of genocide of an unknown purpose. Sovereign is a vanguard whose purpose is to trigger the imminent return of the Reaper fleet hibernating in extra-galactic dark space, starting the process of extermination yet again. The second game takes place two years later, and sees Shepard battling the Collectors, an alien race abducting entire human colonies in a plan to help the Reapers return to the Milky Way. The final game of Shepard's trilogy centers on the final battle against the Reapers.</p>
    <p>All three games have received critical acclaim for their storyline, characters, romances, voice acting, choices and the depth of the galaxy. Video game website GamesRadar called <i>Mass Effect</i> the best new franchise of the generation, saying that the galaxy was so well-constructed that it felt like a decades-old franchise and that it represented "a high-water mark for video games as a story-telling medium."</p>

    <p><b>Dame Julie Elizabeth Andrews</b>, DBE (born 1 October 1935) is an English film and stage actress, singer, author, theatre director, and dancer. In 2000, she was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II for services to the performing arts.</p>
    <p>Andrews is a former child actress and singer who appeared on the West End in 1948, and made her Broadway debut in a 1954 production of <i>The Boy Friend</i>, and rose to prominence starring in musicals such as <i>My Fair Lady</i> and <i>Camelot</i>, both of which earned her Tony Award nominations. In 1957, she appeared on television with the title role in <i>Cinderella</i>, which was seen by over 100 million viewers.</p>
    <p>Andrews made her feature film debut in <i>Mary Poppins</i> (1964), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She received her second Academy Award nomination for <i>The Sound of Music</i> (1965), and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Adjusted for inflation, the latter film is the third-highest grossing film of all time. Between 1964 and 1967, Andrews had other box office successes with <i>The Americanization of Emily</i>, <i>Hawaii</i>, Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Torn Curtain</i>, and <i>Thoroughly Modern Millie</i>, making her the most successful film star in the world at that time.</p>
    <p>In the 1970s, Andrews' film career slowed down following the commercial disappointments of <i>Star!</i>, <i>Darling Lili</i>, and <i>The Tamarind Seed</i>. She returned to prominence with the critical and commercial successes of <i>10</i> (1979) and <i>Victor Victoria</i> (1982), receiving a third Academy Award nomination. During the remainder of the 1980s, she starred in critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful films such as <i>That's Life!</i> and <i>Duet for One</i>, before her career went into eclipse in the 1990s.</p>

In 2003, Andrews revisited her first Broadway success, this time as a stage director, with a revival of <i>The Boy Friend</i> at the Bay Street Theatre, Sag Harbor, New York.</p>
    <p>Andrews is also an author of children's books, and in 2008 published an autobiography, <i>Home: A Memoir of My Early Years</i>, which includes memories of surviving the London Blitz. In addition to an Academy Award, she has won a BAFTA, five Golden Globes, three Grammys, two Emmys, the Disney Legend award and the Kennedy Center Honors. In 2002, she was placed at number 59 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.</p>

    <p><b>Facebook</b> is an online social networking service. Its name comes from a colloquialism for the directory given to students at some American universities. Facebook was founded on February 4, 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities before it opened to high-school students, and eventually to anyone aged 13 and over. Facebook now allows anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old to become a registered user of the website.</p>
    <p>Users must register before using the site, after which they may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, exchange messages, and receive automatic notifications when they update their profile. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". In September 2012, Facebook had over one billion active users, of which approximately 9% were fake. In 2012, Facebook was adding over half a petabyte of data every 24 hours, amounting to about 180 petabytes per year.</p>

    <p><b>Amethyst Amelia Kelly</b> (born 7 June 1990), better known by her stage name <b>Iggy Azalea</b> (/əˈzeɪljə/), is an Australian recording artist and model from Mullumbimby, New South Wales. She relocated to the United States at the age of 16, first staying in Miami, Florida, and then other parts of the South, including Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. She first gained recognition after the respective music videos for her controversial songs "Pussy" and "Two Times" went viral on YouTube. On 27 September 2011, Azalea released her first full-length project, a mixtape entitled <i>Ignorant Art</i>, saying she made it "with the intent to make people question and redefine old ideals." In 2012, she announced her signing to Mercury Records and the following year to Island Def Jam. Azalea went into professional modeling, when she became represented by Wilhelmina Models, in the spring of 2012; later that year she was announced the "New Face of Levi Jeans".</p>
    <p>In 2012, Azalea became the first female and non-American rapper to be featured on <i>XXL</i> magazine's annual Top 10 Freshman cover issue. On 30 July 2012, she released <i>Glory</i>, her debut extended play (EP), which was executive produced by American rapper and Grand Hustle label-boss T.I.. The EP was composed of songs originally meant to appear on Azalea's long-awaited and often-delayed debut album. On 11 October 2012, she released her second mixtape <i>TrapGold</i>, which was produced entirely by high-profile producer Diplo, as well as 1st Down of production team FKi. The mixtape is significant for foreshadowing Azalea's new approach to music and her later work, which heavily includes electronic elements. <sup style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>check quotation syntax</i>]</sup> Azalea's debut studio album <i>The New Classic</i> was released on 21 April 2014. Initially set to be released with Grand Hustle and Interscope Records, after label conflicts, in 2013 Azalea finally secured a deal with Mercury Records and later Island Def Jam, to release her debut album. The album was preceded by the lead single and Azalea's commercial debut single "Work", which successfully charted on several international music charts and peaked at No. 17 on the UK Singles Chart. The other three singles released in promotion for the album were "Bounce", "Change Your Life" and "Fancy", with the latter two featuring guest appearances from T.I. and Charli XCX, respectively.</p>
