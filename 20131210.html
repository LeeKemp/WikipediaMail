		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 10 December 2013 </h1><h2> RMS Titanic</h2><p><b>RMS <i>Titanic</i></b> was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City, US. The sinking of <i>Titanic</i> caused the deaths of more than 1,500 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The RMS <i>Titanic</i> was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service. <i>Titanic</i> was the second of three <i>Olympic</i> class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line, and was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast with Thomas Andrews as her naval architect. Andrews was among those lost during the sinking. On her maiden voyage, she carried 2,224 passengers and crew.</p>
<p>Under the command of Edward Smith, the ship's passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe seeking a new life in North America. The ship was designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. A wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use. Though <i>Titanic</i> had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, there were not enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard due to outdated maritime safety regulations. <i>Titanic</i> only carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly more than half of the number on board, and one-third her total capacity.</p>
<p>After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, <i>Titanic</i> called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland before heading westwards towards New York. On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (604 km) south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm ship's time. The glancing collision caused <i>Titanic</i>'s hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; the ship gradually filled with water. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partly loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "women and children first" protocol followed by some of the officers loading the lifeboats. By 2:20 AM, she broke apart and foundered, with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after <i>Titanic</i> foundered, the Cunard liner RMS <i>Carpathia</i> arrived on the scene of the sinking, where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.</p>
<p>The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers. Many of the survivors lost all of their money and possessions and were left destitute; many families, particularly those of crew members from Southampton, lost their primary bread-winners. They were helped by an outpouring of public sympathy and charitable donations. Some of the male survivors were accused of cowardice for leaving the ship while people were still on board; the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, faced social ostracism for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>The wreck of <i>Titanic</i> remains on the seabed, split in two and gradually disintegrating at a depth of 12,415 feet (3,784 m). Since her discovery in 1985, thousands of artefacts have been recovered and put on display at museums around the world. <i>Titanic</i> has become one of the most famous ships in history, her memory kept alive by numerous books, folk songs, films, exhibits, and memorials.</p>

<p>The contract to build the USS <i>Hopper</i> was awarded to Bath Iron Works Corporation in Bath, Maine on 8 April 1992 and her keel was laid down on 23 February 1995. She was launched on 6 January 1996 sponsored by Mrs. Mary Murray Westcote, sister of the ship's namesake, and commissioned on 6 September 1997 in San Francisco to be near Silicon Valley, with Commander Thomas D. Crowley in command.</p>
<p>The USS <i>Hopper</i> is only the second U.S. Navy warship to be named for a woman from the Navy's own ranks. The other was the World War II destroyer USS <i>Higbee</i> named for the Superintendent of the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps during World War I, Lenah Higbee.</p>
