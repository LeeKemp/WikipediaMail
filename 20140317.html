		<h1>Popular Pages - Monday 17 March 2014 </h1><h2> Holi</h2><p><b>Holi</b> (<small>English</small> <small>pronunciation:</small> /ˈhoʊliː/) (Sanskrit: होली) is a spring festival also known as the festival of colours and the festival of love. It is an ancient Hindu religious festival which has become popular with non-Hindus in many parts of South Asia, as well as people of other communities.</p>
<p>It is primarily observed in India, Nepal, and other regions of the world with significant populations of Hindus or people of Indian origin. The festival has, in recent times, spread in parts of Europe and North America as a spring celebration of love, frolic and colours.</p>
<p>Holi celebrations start with a Holika bonfire on the night before Holi where people gather, sing and dance. The next morning is a free for all carnival of colours, where everyone plays, chases and colours each other with dry powder and coloured water, with some carrying water guns and coloured water-filled balloons for their water fight. Anyone and everyone is fair game, friend or stranger, rich or poor, man or woman, children and elders. The frolic and fight with colours occurs in the open streets, open parks, outside temples and buildings. Groups carry drums and musical instruments, go from place to place, sing and dance. People move and visit family, friends and foes, first play with colours on each other, laugh and chit-chat, then share Holi delicacies, food and drinks. In the evening, after sobering up, people dress up, visit friends and family.</p>
<p>Holi is celebrated at the approach of vernal equinox, on the Phalguna Purnima (Full Moon). The festival date varies every year, per the Hindu calendar, and typically comes in March, sometimes February in the Gregorian Calendar. The festival signifies the victory of good over evil, the arrival of spring, end of winter, and for many a festive day to meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair ruptured relationships.</p>

Due to recent political instability in the region, national sovereignty over the peninsula is currently being disputed by Russia (March 2014). The Autonomous Republic of Crimea includes nearly all of the North Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, with the small exception of Sevastopol.</p>
<p>Since ca. 700 BC, the peninsula has changed hands well over a dozen times, having been controlled by Cimmerians, Bulgars, Greeks, Scythians, Romans, Goths, Huns, Khazars, Kievan Rus' (early Ukraine), Byzantine Greeks, Venitians, Genoese, Kipchaks, Ottoman Turks, Golden Horde Tatars, Mongols, Russians, Germans and modern Ukrainians.</p>
<p>The Autonomous Republic of Crimea is an autonomous parliamentary republic within Ukraine and is governed by the Constitution of Crimea in accordance with the laws of Ukraine. The capital and administrative seat of the republic's government is the city of Simferopol, located in the center of the peninsula. Crimea's area is 26,200 square kilometers (10,100 sq mi) and its population was 1,973,185 as of 2007. These figures do not include the area and population of the City of Sevastopol (2007 population: 379,200), which is administratively separate from the autonomous republic. The peninsula thus has 2,352,385 people (2007 estimate).</p>
<p>Crimean Tatars, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority who in 2001 made up 12.10% of the population, formed in Crimea in the late Middle Ages, after the Crimean Khanate had come into existence. The Crimean Tatars were forcibly expelled to Central Asia by Joseph Stalin's government. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Crimean Tatars began to return to the region. According to the 2001 Ukrainian population census 58% of the population of Crimea are ethnic Russians and 24% are ethnic Ukrainians. The region has a high proportion of Muslims.</p>
<p>On March 11, 2014, the parliament of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea adopted a Crimean declaration of independence from Ukraine, ahead of a planned referendum.</p>

</ul><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Lights' >More...</a><hr><h2> Saint Patrick</h2><p><b>Saint Patrick</b> (Latin: <i>Patricius</i>; Proto-Irish: <i>*Qatrikias</i>; Modern Irish: <i>Pádraig</i>;<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>needs IPA</i>]</sup> Welsh: <i>Padrig</i>) was a 5th-century Romano-British Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland. Known as the "Apostle of Ireland", he is the primary patron saint of the island along with Saints Brigit and Columba.</p>
<p>The dates of Patrick's life cannot be fixed with certainty but, on a widespread interpretation, he was active as a missionary in Ireland during the second half of the fifth century. He is generally credited with being the first bishop of Armagh, Primate of Ireland.</p>
<p>When he was about 16, he was captured from his home in Great Britain, and taken as a slave to Ireland, where he lived for six years before escaping and returning to his family. After becoming a cleric, he returned to northern and western Ireland. In later life, he served as an ordained bishop, but little is known about the places where he worked. By the seventh century, he had already come to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland.</p>
<p>Saint Patrick's Day is observed on 17 March, the date of his death. It is celebrated inside and outside Ireland as a religious and cultural holiday. In the dioceses of Ireland, it is both a solemnity and a holy day of obligation; it is also a celebration of Ireland itself.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick' >More...</a><hr><h2> Saint Patrick's Day</h2><p><b>Saint Patrick's Day</b> or the <b>Feast of Saint Patrick</b> (Irish: <i>Lá Fhéile Pádraig</i>, "the Day of the Festival of Patrick") is a cultural and religious holiday celebrated annually on 17 March, the death date of the most commonly-recognised patron saint of Ireland, Saint Patrick (<abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> AD 385–461).</p>
<p>Saint Patrick's Day was made an official Christian feast day in the early seventeenth century and is observed by the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion (especially the Church of Ireland), the Eastern Orthodox Church and Lutheran Church. The day commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, as well as celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general. Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, céilithe, and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks. Christians also attend church services, and the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol are lifted for the day, which has encouraged and propagated the holiday's tradition of alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Saint Patrick's Day is a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Newfoundland and Labrador and Montserrat. It is also widely celebrated by the Irish diaspora around the world; especially in Britain, Canada, the United States, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand.</p>

The Viking forces were led by a Danish chieftain named "Reginherus", or Ragnar, who traditionally has been identified with the legendary saga character Ragnar Lodbrok. Ragnar's fleet of 120 Viking ships, carrying thousands of men, entered the Seine in March and proceeded sailing up the river. The West Frankish king Charles the Bald assembled a smaller army in response, but as the Vikings defeated one division, comprising half of the army, the remaining forces retreated. The Vikings reached Paris at the end of the month, during Easter. After plundering and occupying the city, the Vikings finally withdrew after receiving a ransom payment of 7,000 French livres, or pounds (2,570 kilograms (5,670 lb)) of silver and gold from Charles the Bald.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Paris_(845)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Fred Phelps</h2><p><b>Fred Waldron Phelps, Sr.</b> (born November 13, 1929) is an American pastor who headed the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), an independent Baptist church based in Topeka, Kansas, prior to his excommunication in 2013. Phelps is a disbarred lawyer, founder of the Phelps Chartered law firm, and a former civil rights activist. He has sought public office four times. In the election for United States Senator for Kansas in 1992, he received 49,416 votes (30.8%) in the Democratic primary, coming in second after Gloria O'Dell (who subsequently lost to later presidential candidate Bob Dole).</p>
<p>Phelps's followers frequently picket various events, such as military funerals, gay pride gatherings, high-profile political gatherings, university commencement ceremonies, performances of <i>The Laramie Project</i>, mainstream Christian gatherings and concerts with which he had no affiliation, arguing it is their sacred duty to warn others of God's anger, leading a group of motorcycle riders to form the Patriot Guard Riders to provide a nonviolent, volunteer buffer between the protesters and mourners.</p>
<p>In response to Phelps' protests at military funerals, President George W. Bush signed the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act into law in May 2006, and, in April 2007, Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius signed into law a bill establishing a 150-foot no-picketing buffer zone around funerals. As of April 2006<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup>, 8 other states have enacted similar laws and 10 more were considering it. On August 6, 2012, President Obama signed Pub.L. 112–154, the Honoring America’s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 which, among other things, requires a 300-foot and 2-hour buffer zone around military funerals.</p>
<p>He is known for the slogans that he and his ministry use against people he deems sinful; his church is built around a core of anti-homosexual theology, with many of their activities stemming from the slogan "God hates fags", which is also the name of the group's main website. Gay rights supporters have denounced him as a producer of anti-gay propaganda and violence-inspiring hate speech. The church is considered a hate group and monitored by the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>
<p>Phelps has long been estranged from family members who left the Westboro Baptist Church. In March 2014, his estranged sons Nathan and Mark reported that he was in very poor health and receiving hospice care. It was also said that Phelps had been excommunicated from the church in the summer of 2013. </p>
