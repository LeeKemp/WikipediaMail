		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 20 March 2014 </h1><h2> Equinox</h2><p>An <b>equinox</b> occurs twice a year (around 20 March and 22 September), when the plane of Earth's equator passes the center of the Sun. At this time the tilt of the Earth's axis is inclined neither away from nor towards the Sun. The term <i>equinox</i> can also be used in a broader sense, meaning the date when such a passage happens. The name "equinox" is derived from the Latin <i>aequus</i> (equal) and <i>nox</i> (night), because around the equinox, night and day are about equal length.</p>
<p>At an equinox the Sun is at one of two opposite points on the celestial sphere where the celestial equator (i.e. declination 0) and ecliptic intersect. These points of intersection are called <b>equinoctial points</b>: classically, the <b>vernal point</b> (RA = 00<sup>h</sup> 00<sup>m</sup> 00<sup>s</sup> and longitude = 0º) and the <b>autumnal point</b> (RA = 12<sup>h</sup> 00<sup>m</sup> 00<sup>s</sup> and longitude = 180º). By extension, the term <i>equinox</i> may denote an equinoctial point.</p>
<p>The equinoxes are the only times when the subsolar point (the place on Earth's surface where the center of the Sun is exactly overhead) is on the Equator. The subsolar point crosses the Equator moving northward at the March equinox and moving southward at the September equinox. (Since the sun's ecliptic latitude is not exactly zero it is not exactly above the equator at the moment of the equinox, but the two events usually occur less than 30 seconds apart.)</p>
<p>The equinoxes are the only times when the terminator is perpendicular to Earth's equator. Thus the Northern and Southern hemispheres are illuminated equally. (At the solstices, that angle reaches its minimum of 66.5°, corresponding to 90° minus Earth's axial tilt).</p>
<p>Another meaning of <b>equinox</b> is the date when day and night are the same length. The equinox is not exactly the same as the day when day and night are of equal length for two reasons. Firstly, because of the size of the sun, the top of the disk rises above the horizon (constituting 'sunrise' which is the start of 'daytime') when the center of the disk is still below the horizon. Secondly, Earth's atmosphere refracts sunlight which means that an observer can experience light (daytime) even before the first glimpse of the sun's disk has risen above the horizon. To avoid this ambiguity the term <b>equilux</b> is sometimes used in this sense. Times of sunset and sunrise vary with an observer's location (longitude and latitude), so the dates when day and night are of exactly equal length likewise depend on location. For places near the equator the daytime is always longer than the night, so they would never experience an equinox by this definition.</p>

Nevertheless, some deviations from historical fact were made to increase interest, some to maintain narrative continuity, and some were for practical or safety reasons. The public perception of what ancient Rome was like, due to previous Hollywood movies, made some historical facts, according to Scott, "too unbelievable" to include.</p>
<p>At least one historical advisor resigned due to the changes he made and another advisor Kathleen Coleman asked not to be mentioned in the credits. Historians called the movie both the worst and best of all films: the worst for the historical inaccuracies in a film Scott promoted as historically accurate, and the best for the film's accurate depiction of the people and violence of the late 2nd century AD. Historian Allen Ward of the University of Connecticut noted that historical accuracy would not have made <i>Gladiator</i> less interesting or exciting and stated: "creative artists need to be granted some poetic license, but that should not be a permit for the wholesale disregard of facts in historical fiction."</p>

Job analyses provide information to organizations which helps to determine which employees are best fit for specific jobs. Through job analysis, the analyst needs to understand what the important tasks of the job are, how they are carried out, and the necessary human qualities needed to complete the job successfully. The process of job analysis involves the analyst describing the duties of the incumbent, then the nature and conditions of work, and finally some basic qualifications. After this, the job analyst has completed a form called a <b>job psychograph</b>, which displays the mental requirements of the job. The measure of a sound job analysis is a valid task list. This list contains the functional or duty areas of a position, the related tasks, and the basic training recommendations. Subject matter experts (incumbents) and supervisors for the position being analyzed need to validate this final list in order to validate the job analysis. Job analysis is crucial for first, helping individuals develop their careers, and also for helping organizations develop their employees in order to maximize talent. The outcomes of job analysis are key influences in designing learning, developing performance interventions, and improving processes. The application of job analysis techniques makes the implicit assumption that information about a job as it presently exists may be used to develop programs to recruit, select, train, and appraise people for the job as it will exist in the future.</p>
<p>Job analysts are typically industrial/organizational psychologists or human resource officers who have been trained by, and are acting under the supervision of an industrial/organizational psychologist. One of the first industrial-organizational psychologists to introduce job analysis was Morris Viteles. In 1922, he used job analysis in order to select employees for a trolley car company. Viteles' techniques could then be applied to any other area of employment using the same process. Job analysis was also conceptualized by two of the founders of Industrial-Organizational psychology, Frederick Winslow Taylor and Lillian Moller Gilbreth in the early 20th century.[1] Since then, experts have presented many different systems to accomplish job analysis that have become increasingly detailed over the decades. However, evidence shows that the root purpose of job analysis, understanding the behavioral requirements of work, has not changed in over 85 years.</p>

It lies to the west of the southern part of South Andaman Island. Most of the island is forested. It is small, located away from the main settlements on Great Andaman, surrounded by coral reefs, and lacks natural harbors.</p>
<p>A group of indigenous people, the Sentinelese, live on North Sentinel Island. Their population is estimated to be between 50 and 400 individuals. The Sentinelese reject any contact with other people, and are among the last people to remain virtually untouched by modern civilization.</p>

<p><b>Ilha de Queimada Grande</b>, nicknamed <b>Snake Island</b>, is a 430,000-square-metre (43-hectare) island off the coast of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. It is home to a species of fer-de-lance, the Golden Lancehead Viper (<i>Bothrops insularis</i>), which is one of the most venomous snakes in the world. Local legend claims there are five snakes to every square meter, while a documentary on the Discovery Channel claims that in some places there are as many as one snake per square meter. The Golden Lancehead is the only species of snake on the island, yet is considered in danger of extinction since it has no other habitat and might be wiped out by wildfire. The viper population is also at risk from inbreeding, effects of which are evident in the population.</p>
<p>Plans to build a banana plantation on the island fizzled, but this is likely the origin of the island's name, as in Portuguese, <i>queimada</i> is a name for a slash-and-burn fire (i.e., to clear land for agriculture); so, the island's name would mean "the island of the big land-clearing fire." For a long time, the island's only inhabitant was a lighthouse keeper. Currently, the Brazilian Navy bans civilians from the island, though scientists sometimes receive waivers.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilha_da_Queimada_Grande' >More...</a><hr><h2> Natalie Imbruglia</h2><p><b>Natalie Jane Imbruglia</b> (/ɪmˈbruːliə/; born 4 February 1975) is an Australian singer/songwriter, model, and actress. In the early 1990s, Imbruglia was known to audiences as Beth Brennan in the popular Australian soap opera <i>Neighbours</i>. Three years after leaving the programme, Imbruglia launched a singing career with the international hit "Torn".</p>
<p>Her subsequent debut album, <i>Left of the Middle</i> (1997), sold over 6 million copies worldwide. Further releases, <i>White Lilies Island</i> (2001) and <i>Counting Down the Days</i> (2005), have been unable to match the commercial success of her debut, although the latter did become her first UK No. 1. In 2007 she released <i>Glorious: The Singles 97–07</i>, a greatest hits compilation featuring the single "Glorious", which peaked at number 23 in the UK Singles Chart.</p>
<p>Her latest album to date, <i>Come to Life</i> (2009), proved the least commercially successful in Australia and Europe, with a UK release cancelled altogether. She co-starred in the 2003 film <i>Johnny English</i> and made her leading actress debut in the 2009 film <i>Closed for Winter</i>.</p>

The forest contains a number of rocky, icy caverns, a few of which are popular tourist destinations. Due to the wind-blocking density of the trees and an absence of nearly any wildlife, the forest is known for being exceptionally quiet.</p>
<p>The forest has a historic association with demons in Japanese mythology and is a popular place for suicides (54 in 2010) despite numerous signs, in Japanese and English, urging people to reconsider their actions.</p>

It is set in a society which is at first presented as a utopian society and gradually appears more and more dystopian. The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life. The society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to "Sameness," a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives.</p>
<p>Jonas is selected to inherit the position of "Receiver of Memory," the person who stores all the past memories of the time before Sameness, in case they are ever needed to aid in decisions that others lack the experience to make. When Jonas meets the previous receiver—The "Giver"—he is confused in many ways. Additionally, the Giver is able to break some rules, such as turning off the speaker that listens to peoples' conversations in their homes, and lying to people of the community. As Jonas receives the memories from the Giver, he discovers the power of knowledge. The people in his community are happy because they do not know of a better life, and the knowledge of what they are missing out on could create major chaos. He faces a dilemma: Should he stay with the community and the safe, consistent but shallow life it offers, or should he run away in pursuit of a life full of love, color, choices, and knowledge, but also potentially full of danger?</p>
<p><i>The Giver</i> won the 1994 Newbery Medal and has sold more than 5.3 million copies. In Australia, Canada, and the United States, it is a part of many middle school reading lists, but it is also on many challenged book lists and appeared on the American Library Association's list of most challenged books of the 1990s.</p>
<p>The novel forms a loose quartet with three other books set in the same future era: <i>Gathering Blue</i> (2000), <i>Messenger</i> (2004), and <i>Son</i> (2012).</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giver' >More...</a><hr><h2> Screw (simple machine)</h2><p>A <b>screw</b> is a mechanism that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force. It is one of the six classical simple machines. The most common form consists of a cylindrical shaft with helical grooves or ridges called <i>threads</i> around the outside. The screw passes through a hole in another object or medium, with threads on the inside of the hole that mesh with the screw's threads. When the shaft of the screw is rotated relative to the stationary threads, the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it; for example rotating a wood screw forces it into wood. In screw mechanisms, either the screw shaft can rotate through a threaded hole in a stationary object, or a threaded collar such as a nut can rotate around a stationary screw shaft. Geometrically, a screw can be viewed as a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.</p>
<p>Other mechanisms that use the same principle, also called screws, don't necessarily have a shaft or threads. For example, a corkscrew is a helix-shaped rod with a sharp point, and an Archimedes' screw is a water pump that uses a rotating helical chamber to move water uphill. The common principle of all screws is that a rotating helix can cause linear motion.</p>
<p>A screw can amplify force; a small rotational force (torque) on the shaft can exert a large axial force on a load. The smaller the pitch, the distance between the screw's threads, the greater the mechanical advantage, the ratio of output to input force. Screws are widely used in threaded fasteners to hold objects together, and in devices such as screw tops for containers, vises, screw jacks and screw presses.</p>
