<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bilzerian' >More...</a><hr><h2> 9×19mm Parabellum</h2><p>The <b>9×19mm Parabellum</b> (abbreviated 9mm, 9mmP, 9×19mm or 9×19) cartridge was designed by Georg Luger and introduced in 1902 by the German weapons manufacturer Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) for their Luger semi-automatic pistol. For this reason, it is designated as the <b>9mm Luger / 9mm Luger +P</b> by the SAAMI  and the <b>9 mm Luger</b> by the C.I.P. (differentiating it from the 9mm Makarov and 9mm Browning cartridges). Under STANAG 4090, it is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries.</p>
<p>The name <i>Parabellum</i> is derived from the Latin: <i>Si vis pacem, para bellum</i> ("If you want peace, prepare for war"), which was the motto of DWM.</p>
<p>According to the 2006 edition of <i>Cartridges of the World</i>, the 9×19mm Parabellum is "the world's most popular and widely used military handgun cartridge." In addition to being used by over 60% of police in the U.S., <i>Newsweek</i> credits 9×19 pistol sales with making semi-automatic pistols more popular than revolvers. The popularity of this cartridge can be attributed to the widely held conviction that it is effective in police and self-defense use. Its low cost and wide availability are self-sustaining contributors to the caliber's continuing popularity.</p>
