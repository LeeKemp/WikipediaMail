He was best known for his work in Hindi films from 1977 to 1989 and for his work in television between 1988 and 2002. He returned to acting in films in 2008 and continued to do so until his death on 27 December 2013. His major contribution was in Parallel Cinema or the New Indian Cinema. He had worked with directors like Satyajit Ray, Muzaffar Ali, Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Ketan Mehta.</p>
<p>He had acted in many serials and shows on television and performed on stage in famous productions such as <i>Tumhari Amrita</i> (1992), alongside Shabana Azmi, directed by Feroz Abbas Khan, and presented the TV show, <i>Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai</i> (Season 1). He won the 2010 National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor for <i>Lahore</i>. He died on 27 December 2013 following a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farooq_Sheikh' >More...</a><hr><h2> Johannes Kepler</h2><p><b>Johannes Kepler</b> (<small>German:</small> [ˈkʰɛplɐ]; December 27, 1571 – November 15, 1630) was a German mathematician, astronomer and astrologer. A key figure in the 17th century scientific revolution, he is best known for his eponymous laws of planetary motion, codified by later astronomers, based on his works <i>Astronomia nova</i>, <i>Harmonices Mundi</i>, and <i>Epitome of Copernican Astronomy</i>. These works also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation.</p>
<p>During his career, Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz, Austria, where he became an associate of Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg. Later he became an assistant to astronomer Tycho Brahe, and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II and his two successors Matthias and Ferdinand II. He was also a mathematics teacher in Linz, Austria, and an adviser to General Wallenstein. Additionally, he did fundamental work in the field of optics, invented an improved version of the refracting telescope (the Keplerian Telescope), and mentioned the telescopic discoveries of his contemporary Galileo Galilei.</p>
<p>Kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology, but there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts) and physics (a branch of natural philosophy). Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason. Kepler described his new astronomy as "celestial physics", as "an excursion into Aristotle's <i>Metaphysics</i>", and as "a supplement to Aristotle's <i>On the Heavens</i>", transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics.</p>
