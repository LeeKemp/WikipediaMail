		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 18 February 2014 </h1><h2> James Barry (surgeon)</h2><p><b>James Miranda Stuart Barry</b> (c. 1789-1799 – 25 July 1865, born <b>Margaret Ann Bulkley</b>), was a military surgeon in the British Army. After graduation from the University of Edinburgh Medical School, Barry served in India and Cape Town, South Africa. By the end of his career, he had risen to the rank of Inspector General in charge of military hospitals. In his travels he not only improved conditions for wounded soldiers, but also the conditions of the native inhabitants. Among his accomplishments was the first caesarean section in Africa by a British surgeon in which both the mother and child survived the operation.</p>
<p>Although Barry lived his adult life as a man, it is believed that at birth he was identified or assigned as female and named Margaret Ann Bulkley, raised as a girl, and that he chose to live as a man so that he might be accepted as a university student and able to pursue a career as a surgeon. Thus Barry would be the first British woman to become a qualified medical doctor.</p>

Numerous people took to dancing for days without rest, and, over the period of about one month, some of those affected died of heart attack, stroke, or exhaustion.</p>

The band is best known for their eclectic sampling, quirky lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the jazz rap and alternative hip hop subgenres. The members are Kelvin Mercer (Posdnuos, Mercenary, Plug Wonder Why, Plug One), David Jude Jolicoeur (Trugoy the Dove, Dave, Plug Two) and Vincent Mason (P.A. Pasemaster Mase, Maseo, Plug Three, Baby Huey). The three formed the group in high school and caught the attention of producer Prince Paul with a demo tape of the song "Plug Tunin'". Prince Paul was also sometimes referred to as Plug Four. The Plug names are alleged to come from the numbers that each bandmate's microphone was labeled on the soundboard. Posdnuos was always plugged into plug one, Trugoy was plugged into plug two, and so forth.</p>
<p>With its playful wordplay, innovative sampling, and witty skits, the band's debut album, <i>3 Feet High and Rising</i>, is considered<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>who?</i>]</sup> a hip hop masterpiece. It is also the band's biggest commercial success to date, with their subsequent albums selling progressively less, despite receiving high praise from critics. A measure of <i>3 Feet High and Rising'</i>s cross-over appeal was the fact that it was voted Album of the Year by <i>NME</i>, a title better known for its taste in guitar-based music. <i>De La Soul</i> has influenced numerous other hip hop artists such as Camp Lo, The Black Eyed Peas, and Digable Planets. They were also influential in the early stages of rapper/actor Mos Def's career, and are a core part of the Spitkicker collective. They are the second longest standing Native Tongues Posse group, after the Jungle Brothers.</p>
<p>In 2006, the group won a Grammy for their collaboration with Gorillaz on the single "Feel Good Inc."</p>
