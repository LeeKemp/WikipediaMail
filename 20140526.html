		<h1>Popular Pages - Monday 26 May 2014 </h1><h2> Halley's Comet</h2><p><b>Halley's Comet</b> or <b>Comet Halley</b> (/ˈhæli/ or /ˈheɪli/), officially designated <b>1P/Halley</b>, is the best-known of the short-period comets and is visible from Earth every 75–76 years. Halley is the only short-period comet that is clearly visible to the naked eye from Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular, but will appear only once in thousands of years. Halley last appeared in the inner Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.</p>
<p>Halley's returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BC. Clear records of the comet's appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time. The comet's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley, after whom it is now named.</p>
<p>During its 1986 apparition, Halley's Comet became the first to be observed in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation. These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's "dirty snowball" model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices – such as water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, – and dust. The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, now it is understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet' >More...</a><hr><h2> One red paperclip</h2><p>The website <b>One red paperclip</b> was created by Canadian blogger Kyle MacDonald, who bartered his way from a single red paperclip to a house in a series of fourteen online trades over the course of a year. MacDonald was inspired by the childhood game <i>Bigger, Better</i>, and the site received a considerable amount of notice for tracking the transactions. "A lot of people have been asking how I've stirred up so much publicity around the project, and my simple answer is: 'I have no idea'", he told the BBC.</p>

Wozniak single-handedly designed both the Apple I and Apple II computers in the late 1970s. These computers contributed significantly to the microcomputer revolution.</p>

Produced by Universal Studios, the film was directed by Carl Rinsch and stars Keanu Reeves and Hiroyuki Sanada. Filming started in Budapest in March 2011; it moved to Shepperton Studios in London and was concluded in Japan.</p>
<p>Although it grossed close to $155 million worldwide on the strength of overseas receipts, the movie failed to break even and Variety reported the film as a costly box office disaster which left Universal Studios deeply in the red for 2013.</p>
