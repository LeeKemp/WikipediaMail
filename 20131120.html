		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 20 November 2013 </h1><h2> Michael Crichton</h2><p><b>John Michael Crichton</b> /dʒɑn ˈmaɪkl̩ ˈkɹaɪʔn̩/ (October 23, 1942 – November 4, 2008) was an American best-selling author, physician, producer, director, and screenwriter, best known for his work in the science fiction, medical fiction, and thriller genres. His books have sold over 200 million copies worldwide, and many have been adapted into films. In 1994 Crichton became the only creative artist ever to have works simultaneously charting at No. 1 in television, film, and book sales (with <i>ER</i>, <i>Jurassic Park</i>, and <i>Disclosure</i>, respectively).</p>
<p>His literary works are usually based on the action genre and heavily feature technology. His novels epitomize the techno-thriller genre of literature, often exploring technology and failures of human interaction with it, especially resulting in catastrophes with biotechnology. Many of his future history novels have medical or scientific underpinnings, reflecting his medical training and science background. He was the author of, among others, <i>The Andromeda Strain</i>, <i>Jurassic Park</i>, <i>Congo</i>, <i>Travels</i>, <i>Sphere</i>, <i>Rising Sun</i>, <i>Disclosure</i>, <i>The Lost World</i>, <i>Airframe</i>, <i>Timeline</i>, <i>Prey</i>, <i>State of Fear</i>, <i>Next</i> (the final book published before his death), <i>Pirate Latitudes</i> (published November 24, 2009), and a final unfinished techno-thriller, <i>Micro</i>, which was published in November 2011.</p>

The 2014 World Cup will feature 32 teams, with one place reserved for the hosts, Brazil. The remaining 31 places are determined by a qualification process, in which entrants from among the other 207 teams from the six FIFA confederations will compete. Most qualifying teams have been determined within these confederations, with a limited number of inter-confederation play-offs occurring at the end of the process. Bhutan, Brunei, Guam and Mauritania did not enter, and South Sudan joined FIFA after the qualification process started and therefore could not take part.</p>
<p>The first qualification match, between Montserrat and Belize, was played on 15 June 2011 and the Belizean striker Deon McCaulay scored the first goal in qualification. The originally published schedule would have consisted of 824 qualifying matches, but the withdrawal of the Bahamas and Mauritius means only 816 will be required.</p>
<p>Teams will finish the qualification process on 20 November 2013.</p>

It will be the second time that Brazil has hosted the competition, the previous being in 1950. Brazil will become the fifth country to have hosted the World Cup twice, after Mexico, Italy, France, and Germany.</p>
<p>Thirty-two countries' teams will take part in the finals tournament, playing in 12 cities throughout Brazil. It is scheduled to be the first World Cup to be held in South America since the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, the first time two consecutive World Cups are staged outside Europe, and the first time two consecutive World Cups are staged in the Southern Hemisphere, since the 2010 World Cup was held in South Africa. It will also be the first World Cup to use goal-line technology.</p>
<p>Spain is the defending champion, having defeated the Netherlands 1–0 in the 2010 World Cup final. It will also be the first finals appearance of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup' >More...</a><hr><h2> Cristiano Ronaldo</h2><p><b>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro</b>, <small>OIH</small> (born 5 February 1985), commonly known as <b>Cristiano Ronaldo</b>, is a Portuguese footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish La Liga club Real Madrid and who serves as captain of the Portuguese national team. He became the most expensive footballer in history upon his 2009 move from Manchester United to Real Madrid in a transfer worth £80 million (€94 million/$131.6 million), a record that would later be reportedly broken by Gareth Bale, who joined Real Madrid in 2013 for £85 million (€100 million). Ronaldo's contract with Real Madrid, under the terms of which he is paid €21 million per year (after taxes), makes him the highest-paid footballer in the world, and his buyout clause is valued at €1 billion as per his contract.</p>
<p>Ronaldo began his career as a youth player for Andorinha, where he played for two years, before moving to C.D. Nacional. In 1997, he made a move to Portuguese giants Sporting Clube de Portugal. Ronaldo caught the attention of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who signed him for £12.24 million (€15 million) in 2003. The following season, Ronaldo won his first club honour, the FA Cup.</p>
<p>Ronaldo was the first player playing in England to win all four main PFA and FWA awards, doing so in 2007. In 2008, Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or. He placed second in the Ballon d'Or in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2012. He was awarded the European Golden Shoe in both 2008 and 2011. In 2008, he won three of the four main PFA and FWA trophies and was named the FIFPro Player of the Year, World Soccer Player of the Year, Onze d'Or, and the FIFA World Player of the Year. In 2007 and 2008, Ronaldo was named FWA Footballer of the Year. Ronaldo was the inaugural winner of the FIFA Puskás Award for the Goal of the Year in 2009.</p>
<p>Ronaldo is regarded to be one of the finest footballers in today's game and as one of the greatest of all time. Ronaldo is the first top European league player to reach 40 goals in a single season in two consecutive years, fastest Real Madrid player to reach one hundred league goals, and the first player ever to score against every team in a single season in La Liga. He also holds records for most goals scored in a season for Real Madrid and most goals scored per minute in La Liga for a Real Madrid player. In January 2013, Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 300th club goal.</p>
<p>Ronaldo is a Portuguese international and made his debut against Kazakhstan in August 2003. He has been capped over 100 times and is his country's second-highest goalscorer of all time. With Portugal he has participated in five major tournaments; UEFA Euro 2004, the 2006 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2008, the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012. He scored his first international goal in the opening game of the Euro 2004 against Greece, in addition to helping Portugal reach the final. He took over the captaincy of the side in July 2008 and went on to captain Portugal to the semi-finals at the Euro 2012 and finished the competition as the joint best scorer.</p>
<p>He wore the number 7 shirt at United, which was previously worn by Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. After spending his first year at Madrid wearing the number 9 shirt, he began wearing the number 7 again following the departure of the legendary Raúl.</p>

He is a member of the Senate of Virginia representing the 25th district since 2001. Previously, he was the Democratic nominee for Attorney General of Virginia in 2005 and Governor of Virginia in 2009. He was defeated in both of those races by Bob McDonnell. Deeds lost by just 323 votes in 2005, but was defeated by a wide margin of almost 18 percentage points in 2009. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992 to 2001.</p>
<p>On November 19, 2013, Deeds was critically wounded during an incident at his home in Millboro, in Bath County, Virginia, where he was stabbed multiple times by his son Austin "Gus" Deeds. Gus was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the home.</p>

Within the area studied, graduates are posited to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently. The degree is awarded upon graduation from a university.</p>
<p>In some languages, a master's degree is called a <i>magister</i>, or a cognate can also be used for a person who has the degree. There are various degrees of the same level, such as engineer's degrees, which have different names for historical reasons. See List of master's degrees.</p>
<p>There has recently been an increase in programs leading to these degrees in the United States; more than twice as many of such degrees are now awarded as compared to the 1970s. In Europe, there has been a standardisation of conditions to deliver the master's degrees and most countries offer degrees in all disciplines.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>

<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmol_gap' >More...</a><hr><h2> American cheese</h2><p><b>American cheese</b> is a processed cheese. It is orange, yellow, or white in color and mild in flavor, with a medium-firm consistency, and melts easily. American cheese was originally only white, but is often now modified to yellow. In the past, it was made from a blend of cheeses, most often Colby and Cheddar. Today’s American cheese is generally no longer made from blended cheeses, but instead is manufactured from a set of ingredients such as milk, whey, milkfat, milk protein concentrate, whey protein concentrate, and salt. In the United States, it may not be legally sold as "cheese", and must be labeled as "processed cheese", "cheese product", or similar—e.g., "cheese food". At times even the word "cheese" is missing in the name on the label, e.g. "American slices" or "American singles". In Canada, exactly the same product, often by the same manufacturer with the same label design, used to be sold as "Canadian cheese" or "Canadian slices". Today, most such product in Canada is vaguely labeled just "slices" or "singles". In the United Kingdom, packs are labelled as "singles", although it is commonly called cheese slices.</p>
<p>The marketing label "American Cheese" for processed cheese combined with the prevalence of processed cheese in the U.S compared to the rest of the world has led to the term <i>American cheese</i> being used in the U.S. synonymously in place of processed cheese in America. The term "American cheese" has a legal definition as a type of pasteurized processed cheese under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p>American cheese is used in American cuisine, for example on cheeseburgers, in grilled cheese sandwiches, and in macaroni and cheese.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cheese' >More...</a><hr><h2> Joseph Paul Franklin</h2><p><b>Joseph Paul Franklin</b> (April 13, 1950 – November 20, 2013) was an American serial killer. He was convicted of several murders, and given six life sentences, as well as a death sentence. He confessed to the attempted murders of two prominent men: the magazine publisher Larry Flynt in 1978 and Vernon Jordan, Jr., the civil rights activist, in 1980. Both survived their injuries, but Flynt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Franklin was not convicted in either of those cases.</p>
<p>Because Franklin has repeatedly changed his accounts of some cases, officials cannot determine the full extent of his crimes. His claims of racial motivation have been offset by a defense expert witness who testified in 1997 that Franklin was a paranoid schizophrenic who was not fit to stand trial.</p>
<p>Franklin was on death row for 15 years awaiting execution in the state of Missouri for the 1977 murder of Gerald Gordon. The Missouri Supreme Court set November 20, 2013 as the execution date. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said in a statement that by setting execution dates, the state high court "has taken an important step to see that justice is finally done for the victims and their families."</p>

The series premiere aired after <i>The Vampire Diaries</i> on Thursday, October 3, 2013. A week later, on October 8, 2013, it moved to Tuesdays at 8:00 pm Eastern (7:00 pm Central) in its regular timeslot where it currently leads in <i>Supernatural</i>.</p>

It claims to be the oldest pub in Ireland, dating back to 900, and received a certificate in 2004 from Guinness World Records repeating the claim.</p>
<p>Sean's Bar is located on Main Street, Athlone, on the West Bank of the River Shannon, and was originally known as <i>Luain's Inn</i>. It is often colloquially referred to simply as <i>Sean's</i>.</p>
<p>During renovations in 1970, the walls of the bar were found to be made of wattle and wicker, dating back to the tenth century. According to Frommer's travel guide, the bar holds records of every owner since 900 A.D., including when Boy George owned it briefly in 1987.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean%27s_Bar' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-11-20 11:30:08 -0500 -->
