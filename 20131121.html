OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for wideband digital communication, whether wireless or over copper wires, used in applications such as digital television and audio broadcasting, DSL Internet access, wireless networks, and 4G mobile communications.</p>
<p>OFDM is essentially identical to <b>coded OFDM</b> (<b>COFDM</b>) and <b>discrete multi-tone modulation</b> (<b>DMT</b>), and is a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme used as a digital multi-carrier modulation method. The word "coded" comes from the use of forward error correction (FEC). A large number of closely spaced orthogonal sub-carrier signals are used to carry data on several parallel data streams or channels. Each sub-carrier is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme (such as quadrature amplitude modulation or phase-shift keying) at a low symbol rate, maintaining total data rates similar to conventional <i>single-carrier</i> modulation schemes in the same bandwidth.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of OFDM over single-carrier schemes is its ability to cope with severe channel conditions (for example, attenuation of high frequencies in a long copper wire, narrowband interference and frequency-selective fading due to multipath) without complex equalization filters. Channel equalization is simplified because OFDM may be viewed as using many slowly modulated narrowband signals rather than one rapidly modulated wideband signal. The low symbol rate makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable, making it possible to eliminate intersymbol interference (ISI) and utilize echoes and time-spreading (on analogue TV these are visible as ghosting and blurring, respectively) to achieve a diversity gain, i.e. a signal-to-noise ratio improvement. This mechanism also facilitates the design of single frequency networks (SFNs), where several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency, as the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be combined constructively, rather than interfering as would typically occur in a traditional single-carrier system.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing' >More...</a><hr><h2> Kanaka Dasa</h2><p><b>Kanaka Dasaru</b> (1509-1609) was a poet, philosopher, musician and composer from modern Karnataka. He is known for his Kirtanes and Ugabhoga compositions in the Kannada language for Carnatic music. Like some other Dasas, he often used colloquial language for his compositions. He was a disciple of Vyasathirtha and a follower of Dwaita philosophy propounded by Madhvacharya.</p>

However, the word <i>mortgage</i> alone, in everyday usage, is most often used to mean <i>mortgage loan</i>.</p>
<p>The word <i>mortgage</i> is a French Law term meaning "death pledge", meaning that the pledge ends (dies) when either the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure.</p>
<p>A home buyer or builder can obtain financing (a loan) either to purchase or secure against the property from a financial institution, such as a bank or credit union, either directly or indirectly through intermediaries. Features of mortgage loans such as the size of the loan, maturity of the loan, interest rate, method of paying off the loan, and other characteristics can vary considerably.</p>
<p>In many jurisdictions, though not all (Bali, Indonesia being one exception), it is normal for home purchases to be funded by a mortgage loan. Few individuals have enough savings or liquid funds to enable them to purchase property outright. In countries where the demand for home ownership is highest, strong domestic markets for mortgages have developed.</p>

Her first major role was as a lead cast member on TBS's <i>The Bill Engvall Show</i> (2007–2009) and she subsequently appeared in the independent films <i>The Burning Plain</i> (2008) and <i>Winter's Bone</i> (2010), for which she received nominations for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Satellite Award, Independent Spirit Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress. At age 20, she was the third-youngest actress ever to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. At age 22, her performance in the romantic comedy <i>Silver Linings Playbook</i> (2012) earned her the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Satellite Award and the Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress, amongst other accolades, making her the youngest person ever to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Actress and the second-youngest Best Actress winner.</p>
<p>Lawrence is also known for playing Raven Darkhölme / Mystique in the 2011 film <i>X-Men: First Class</i>, a role she will reprise in <i>X-Men: Days of Future Past</i> in 2014. Beginning in 2012, she achieved international recognition starring as the heroine Katniss Everdeen in <i>The Hunger Games</i> and its three sequels, an adaptation of Suzanne Collins' best-selling series of the same name. Her performance in the films garnered her notable critical praise and marked her as the highest-grossing action heroine of all time. Lawrence's performances thus far have prompted <i>Rolling Stone</i> to call her "the most talented young actress in America." In 2013, <i>Time</i> named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world and <i>ELLE Magazine</i> named her the most powerful woman in the entertainment business.</p>
