		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 09 January 2014 </h1><h2> Simone de Beauvoir</h2><dl><dd><i>"La Beauvoir" redirects here; also see: Beauvoir (disambiguation).</i></dd>
</dl><p><b>Simone-Lucie-Ernestine-Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir</b>, commonly known as <b>Simone de Beauvoir</b> (<small>French: </small>[simɔn də bovwaʁ]; 9 January 1908 – 14 April 1986), was a French writer, intellectual, existentialist philosopher, political activist, feminist, and social theorist. She did not consider herself a philosopher but she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory. Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, an autobiography, and monographs on philosophy, politics, and social issues. She is best known for her novels, including <i>She Came to Stay</i> and <i>The Mandarins</i>, as well as her 1949 treatise <i>The Second Sex</i>, a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism.</p>

Hákarl is an acquired taste; it has a very particular ammonia-rich smell and fishy taste.</p>
<p>Hákarl is served as part of a <i>þorramatur</i>, a selection of traditional Icelandic food served at <i>þorrablót</i> in midwinter. It is readily available in Icelandic stores and is eaten year round.</p>

Established in November 2009, this exceeds the previous record of 2,430 m (2,657 yd) set by Rob Furlong in 2002. This record was certified by Guinness World Records.</p>

</ol><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gullable' >More...</a><hr><h2> Synsepalum dulcificum</h2><p><i><b>Synsepalum dulcificum</b></i>, also known as the <b>miracle fruit</b>, is a plant with a berry that, when eaten, causes sour foods (such as lemons and limes) subsequently consumed to taste sweet. This effect is due to miraculin, which is used commercially as a sugar substitute. Common names for this species and its berry include <b>miracle fruit</b>, <b>miracle berry</b>, <b>miraculous berry</b>, <b>sweet berry</b>, and in West Africa, where the species originates, <b>agbayun</b>, <b>taami</b>, <b>asaa</b>, and <b>ledidi</b>.</p>
<p>The berry itself has a low sugar content and a mildly sweet tang. It contains a glycoprotein molecule, with some trailing carbohydrate chains, called miraculin. When the fleshy part of the fruit is eaten, this molecule binds to the tongue's taste buds, causing sour foods to taste sweet. At neutral pH, miraculin binds and blocks the receptors, but at low pH (resulting from ingestion of sour foods) miraculin binds protons and becomes able to activate the sweet receptors, resulting in the perception of sweet taste. This effect lasts until the protein is washed away by saliva (up to about 60 minutes).</p>
<p>The names <i>miracle fruit</i> and <i>miracle berry</i> are shared by <i>Gymnema sylvestre</i> and <i>Thaumatococcus daniellii</i>, which are two other species of plant used to alter the perceived sweetness of foods.</p>
