		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 22 April 2014 </h1><h2> Cotinine</h2><p><b>Cotinine</b> is an alkaloid found in tobacco and is also a metabolite of nicotine. The word "<i>cotinine</i>" is an anagram of "<i>nicotine</i>". Cotinine is used as a biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke and has also been sold as an antidepressant under the brand name <i><b>Scotine</b></i>.</p>
<p>Similarly to nicotine, cotinine binds to, activates, and desensitizes neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, though at much lower potency in comparison. It has demonstrated nootropic and antipsychotic-like effects in animal models. Direct administration of high levels of cotinine resulted in no significant physiologic, subjective, or performance effects.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotinine' >More...</a><hr><h2> Meb Keflezighi</h2><p><b>Mebrahtom "Meb" Keflezighi</b> (/ˈmɛb kəˈflɛzɡi/; Ge'ez: መብራህቶም ክፍልእዝጊ, <i>mebrāhtōm kifl'igzī</i>; born May 5, 1975) is an American long distance runner. He is the 2004 Olympic silver medalist in the marathon and finished in fourth place in the 2012 Summer Olympics. He won the 2009 New York City Marathon on November 1, 2009 and the 2014 Boston Marathon on April 21, 2014 becoming the first American man to win each race since 1982 and 1983, respectively. Keflezighi is a graduate of UCLA where he won four NCAA championships competing for the UCLA Bruins track and field team.</p>

Its goal is to mitigate discomfort caused by diminished circulating estrogen and progesterone hormones in menopause. Combination HRT is often recommended as it decreases the amount of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer associated with unopposed estrogen therapy. The main hormones involved are estrogen, progesterone and progestin. Some recent therapies include the use of androgens as well.</p>
<p>The 2002 Women's Health Initiative of the National Institutes of Health found disparate results for all cause mortality with hormone replacement, finding it to be lower when HRT was begun earlier, between age 50-59, but higher when begun after age 60. In older patients, there was an increased incidence of breast cancer, heart attacks and stroke, although a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer and bone fracture. Some of the WHI findings were again found in a larger national study done in the UK, known as The Million Women Study. As a result of these findings, the number of women taking hormone treatment dropped precipitously. The Women's Health Initiative recommended that women with non-surgical menopause take the lowest feasible dose of HRT for the shortest possible time to minimize associated risks.</p>
<p>The current indications for use from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration include short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as vasomotor hot flashes or urogenital atrophy, and prevention of osteoporosis. In 2012, the United States Preventive Task Force concluded that the harmful effects of combined estrogen and progestin are likely to exceed the chronic disease prevention benefits in most women. A consensus expert opinion published by the The Endocrine Society stated that when taken during perimenopause, or the initial years of menopause, hormonal therapy carries significantly fewer risks than previously published, and reduces all cause mortality in most patient scenarios. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology also released a position statement in 2009 that approved of HRT in appropriate clinical scenarios.</p>

Rogen began his career performing stand-up comedy during his teenage years, winning the Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest in 1998. While still living in his native Vancouver, he landed a small role in <i>Freaks and Geeks</i>. Shortly after Rogen moved to Los Angeles for his role, <i>Freaks and Geeks</i> was officially cancelled after one season due to low viewership. Rogen later got a part on the equally short-lived <i>Undeclared</i>, which also hired him as a staff writer.</p>
<p>After landing his job as a staff writer on the final season of <i>Da Ali G Show</i>, for which Rogen and the other writers received their Emmy Award nomination, Rogen was guided by Judd Apatow toward a film career. Rogen was cast in a major supporting role and credited as a co-producer in Apatow's directorial debut, <i>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</i>. After Rogen received critical praise for his performance, Universal Pictures agreed to cast him as the lead in Apatow's directorial feature films <i>Knocked Up</i> and <i>Funny People</i>. Rogen and his comedy partner Evan Goldberg co-wrote the films <i>Superbad</i>, <i>Pineapple Express</i>, and <i>This Is the End</i>. Rogen has also done voice work for the films <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i>, <i>Kung Fu Panda</i>, <i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i>, and <i>Paul</i>. Rogen married fellow screenwriter Lauren Miller in October 2011.</p>

It was first celebrated in 1970, and is now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network, and celebrated in more than 192 countries each year.</p>
<p>In 1969 at a UNESCO Conference in San Francisco, peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace, to first be celebrated on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a Proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations. A month later a separate Earth Day was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach-in first held on April 22, 1970. Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Award in recognition of his work. While this April 22 Earth Day was focused on the United States, an organization launched by Denis Hayes, who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations. Numerous communities celebrate <b>Earth Week</b>, an entire week of activities focused on environmental issues.</p>

<p>Cooper was a member of the Magic Circle, and respected by traditional magicians. Famed for his red fez, his appearance was large and lumbering at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and more than 15 stone (210 lb; 95 kg) in weight.</p>
<p>On 15 April 1984, Cooper collapsed and soon after died from a heart attack in front of millions of television viewers, midway through his act on the London Weekend Television variety show <i>Live From Her Majesty's</i>, transmitted live from Her Majesty's Theatre. His stage persona required that his act intentionally go wrong for comic purposes, leading to some initial uncertainty about whether this collapse was real.</p>

He earned a degree in English from St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. He played hockey for the Pictou County Weeks of the Nova Scotia Midget AAA Hockey League when he was in high school. For a short time in 2006, he was engaged to actress Nichole Hiltz. He is best known for his portrayal of "Bubbles" and co-writer of the ongoing cult classic television program, films and stage production Trailer Park Boys.</p>

He was formerly coach for Ajax, Barcelona, AZ and Bayern Munich. Before his career as coach Van Gaal played as a midfielder for Royal Antwerp, Telstar, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ. Van Gaal is also a fully qualified gymnastics teacher, and has worked as such at high-schools during various stages of his career as a semi-professional football-player.</p>
<p>After a brief spell as coach at AZ, Van Gaal served as assistant coach under Leo Beenhakker at Ajax, and eventually took over as head coach in 1991. Under his lead, the club won three Eredivisie titles, the UEFA Cup, and the Champions League. Van Gaal moved to Barcelona in 1997 and won two Spanish league titles and one Copa del Rey. After some disagreements at Barcelona, he was appointed coach of the Netherlands national team, but failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. Another brief spell at Barcelona followed, before he became manager of AZ. After winning the Eredivisie with AZ in 2008–09, he was hired by Bayern Munich on 1 July 2009. In his first season at Bayern, he secured the Bundesliga title, won the DFB-Pokal, and reached the final of the Champions League. In July 2012, he was appointed manager of the Netherlands for the second time.</p>
<p>Van Gaal is an avid promoter of attacking football, educated in the best traditions of the <i>Total Football</i> by Ajax and the Dutch national team of the 1970s. As a coach he is known as a slow starter who frequently finds his players needing ample time to grasp his tactics and intent of play. Generally his teams gather results in the second or third season under his coaching, an exception being the 2009–10 season when he grasped the Bundesliga title and lost the Champions League final with Bayern Munich. During several periods in his career, Van Gaal has had his troubles with the media. He is known to be very blunt with media representatives he perceives to be asking him 'stupid' questions.</p>
