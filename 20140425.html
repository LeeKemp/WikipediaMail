		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 25 April 2014 </h1><h2> Euthanasia Coaster</h2><p>The <b>Euthanasia Coaster</b> is an art concept for a steel roller coaster designed to kill its passengers. In 2010, it was designed and made into a scale model by Julijonas Urbonas, a PhD candidate at the Royal College of Art in London. Urbonas, who has worked at an amusement park, stated that the goal of his concept roller coaster is to take lives "with elegance and euphoria". As for practical applications of his design, Urbonas mentioned "euthanasia" or "execution". John Allen, who served as president of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, inspired Urbonas with his description of the "ultimate" roller coaster as one that "sends out 24 people and they all come back dead". As it would euthanise its passengers, it was criticised by the anti-euthanasia association Care Not Killing.</p>

<p><b>Orientalism</b> is a term used by art historians and literary and cultural studies scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects of Middle Eastern and East Asian cultures (Eastern cultures) by writers, designers and artists from the West. In particular, <b>Orientalist painting</b>, depicting more specifically "the Middle East", was one of the many specialisms of 19th-century Academic art, and the literatures of European countries took a similar interest in Oriental themes.</p>
<p>Since the publication of Edward Said's <i>Orientalism</i> in 1978, much academic discourse has begun to use the term "Orientalism" to refer to a general patronizing Western attitude towards Middle Eastern, Asian and North African societies. In Said's analysis, the West essentializes these societies as static and undeveloped—thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit in this fabrication, writes Said, is the idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and superior.</p>
