<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heavy_(band)' >More...</a><hr><h2> General Educational Development</h2><p><b>General Educational Development</b> or (<b>GED</b>) tests are a group of five subject tests which, when passed, certify that the test taker has American or Canadian high school-level academic skills.</p>
<p>Although the "GED" initialism is frequently mistaken as meaning "general education degree" or "general education diploma", the American Council on Education, which owns the GED trademark, coined the initialism to identify "tests of <b>g</b>eneral <b>e</b>ducational <b>d</b>evelopment" that measure proficiency in science, mathematics, social studies, reading, and writing. Passing the GED test gives those who did not complete high school the opportunity to earn their high school equivalency credential, in the United States or Canada or abroad.</p>
<p>The GED Testing Service, now a joint venture of the American Council on Education and Pearson, is the sole developer for the GED test. The test can be taken by paper or on computer, but tests must be taken in person. Jurisdictions award a <b>Certificate of High School Equivalency</b> or similarly titled credential to persons who meet the passing score requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to English, the GED tests are available in Spanish, French, large print, audio cassette, and braille. Tests and test preparation are also offered to persons incarcerated and on military bases in addition to more traditional settings. Individuals living outside the United States, Canada, or U.S. territories may be eligible to take the GED tests through Pearson Vue testing centers.</p>
