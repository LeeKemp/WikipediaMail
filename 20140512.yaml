  title: Dorothy Hodgkin
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Dorothy Mary Hodgkin</b>, OM, FRS (12 May 1910 – 29 July 1994), <i>née</i> Crowfoot, was a British biochemist, credited with the development of protein crystallography. She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964.</p>
    <p>She advanced the technique of X-ray crystallography, a method used to determine the three-dimensional structures of biomolecules. Among her most influential discoveries are the confirmation of the structure of penicillin that Ernst Boris Chain and Edward Abraham had previously surmised, and then the structure of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, for which she became the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
    <p>In 1969, after 35 years of work and five years after winning the Nobel Prize, Hodgkin was able to decipher the structure of insulin. X-ray crystallography became a widely used tool and was critical in later determining the structures of many biological molecules where knowledge of structure is critical to an understanding of function. She is regarded as one of the pioneer scientists in the field of X-ray crystallography studies of biomolecules. Hodgkin published as Dorothy Crowfoot until 1949, when she was persuaded by Hans Clarke’s secretary to use her married name on her chapter in <i>The Chemistry of Penicillin</i>. Thereafter she always published as Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin.</p>

    <p>The <b>Eglinton West subway</b> was a proposed east-west subway line in Toronto, Ontario, Canada along Eglinton Avenue West. It was to start from the existing Eglinton West Station on the Toronto Transit Commission's Yonge-University-Spadina line and terminate at Black Creek Drive in its initial phase. City of York Mayor Fergy Brown, Metro Toronto Chairman Alan Tonks, Ontario Premier Bob Rae, Ontario Minister of Transportation Gilles Pouliot, and TTC Chair Mike Colle broke ground on the project in a ceremony on 25 August 1994 at Eglinton Avenue and Black Creek Drive; however, work was halted in 1995 when the newly elected Government of Ontario under Mike Harris cancelled the project. The excavation under Eglinton West intended to be Allen Station was subsequently filled in.</p>

  extract: |-
    <p>A <b>mother</b> (or <b>mum</b>/<b>mom/mam</b>) is a woman who has raised a child, given birth to a child, and/or supplied the egg which in union with a sperm grew into a child. The definition can also be extended to non-human animals and may then also include being the animal that donated a body cell which has resulted in a clone. Because of the complexity and differences of a mother's social, cultural, and religious definitions and roles, it is challenging to specify a universally acceptable definition for the term.</p>
    <p>The male parallel is father.</p>

    <p><i><b>Game of Thrones</b></i> is an American fantasy drama television series created for HBO by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is titled <i>A Game of Thrones</i>. Filmed in a Belfast studio and on location elsewhere in Northern Ireland, Malta, Scotland, Croatia, Iceland and Morocco, it premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011. Two days after the fourth season premiered in April 2014, HBO renewed <i>Game of Thrones</i> for a fifth and sixth season.</p>
    <p>The series, set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos at the end of a decade-long summer, interweaves several plot lines. The first follows the members of several noble houses in a civil war for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms; the second covers the rising threat of the impending winter and the mythical creatures of the North; the third chronicles the attempts of the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed dynasty to reclaim the throne. Through its morally ambiguous characters, the series explores the issues of social hierarchy, religion, loyalty, corruption, civil war, crime, and punishment.</p>
    <p><i>Game of Thrones</i> has attracted record numbers of viewers on HBO and obtained an exceptionally broad and active international fan base. It received widespread acclaim by critics, although its frequent use of nudity, violence and sexual violence has attracted criticism. The series has won numerous awards and nominations, including a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Drama Series in all three seasons, a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Television Series – Drama, a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in both Long Form and Short Form, and a Peabody Award. Among the ensemble cast, Peter Dinklage won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for his role as Tyrion Lannister.</p>

  title: Eurovision Song Contest 2014
  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>Eurovision Song Contest 2014</b> was the 59th annual Eurovision Song Contest. The contest took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, following Emmelie de Forest's win in the 2013 contest with the song "Only Teardrops". This is the third time that Denmark has hosted the contest, most recently hosting in 2001. The two semi-finals took place on 6 May and 8 May 2014, and the final on 10 May 2014. The host broadcaster, DR, chose the B&amp;W Hallerne as the host venue after considering several bids from cities and venues across Denmark. The shows were presented by Lise Rønne, Nikolaj Koppel and Pilou Asbæk.</p>
    <p>Thirty-seven countries participated; this includes the return of Poland after a two-year absence and Portugal after a one-year absence. Overall, there were two fewer countries competing compared to the previous year, making thirty-seven participants, the smallest number since 2006. Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Serbia announced their withdrawal from the 2014 Contest. The contest saw the return of Valentina Monetta representing San Marino for a third consecutive year.</p>
    <p>Montenegro and San Marino qualified to the final for the first time since their debuts in 2007 and 2008 respectively, Montenegro earning 19th and San Marino earning 24th place.</p>
    <p>Conchita Wurst of Austria won the final. This was Austria's first win in the competition since 1966. With the polarising nature of LGBT rights in western and eastern Europe, Wurst's status as a drag queen has made some consider Austria's victory in the contest as a political statement as well. The Netherlands placed second and Sweden placed third rounding out the Top 3.</p>

  title: Ocean sunfish
  extract: |
    <p>The <b>ocean sunfish</b>, <i><b>Mola mola</b></i>, or <b>common mola</b>, is the heaviest known bony fish in the world. It has an average adult weight of 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). The species is native to tropical and temperate waters around the globe. It resembles a fish head with a tail, and its main body is flattened laterally. Sunfish can be as tall as they are long when their dorsal and ventral fins are extended.</p>
    <p>Sunfish live on a diet that consists mainly of jellyfish, but because this diet is nutritionally poor, they consume large amounts in order to develop and maintain their great bulk. Females of the species can produce more eggs than any other known vertebrate. Sunfish fry resemble miniature pufferfish, with large pectoral fins, a tail fin and body spines uncharacteristic of adult sunfish.</p>
    <p>Adult sunfish are vulnerable to few natural predators, but sea lions, orcas and sharks will consume them. Among humans, sunfish are considered a delicacy in some parts of the world, including Japan, the Korean peninsula and Taiwan. In the EU, regulations ban the sale of fish and fishery products derived of the Molidae family. Sunfish are frequently, though accidentally, caught in gillnets.</p>
    <p>A member of the order Tetraodontiformes, which also includes pufferfish, porcupinefish and filefish, the sunfish shares many traits common to members of this order. It was originally classified as <i>Tetraodon mola</i> under the pufferfish genus, but it has since been given its own genus, <i>Mola</i>, with two species under it. The ocean sunfish, <i>Mola mola</i>, is the type species of the genus.</p>
