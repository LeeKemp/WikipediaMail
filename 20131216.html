		<h1>Popular Pages - Monday 16 December 2013 </h1><h2> Peter O&#39;Toole</h2><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_O&#39;Toole' >More...</a><hr><h2> Peter O'Toole</h2><p><b>Peter James O'Toole</b> (2 August 1932 – 14 December 2013) was an Irish actor. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and began working in the theatre, gaining recognition as a Shakespearean actor at the Bristol Old Vic and with the English Stage Company, before making his film debut in 1959.</p>
<p>He achieved stardom playing T. E. Lawrence in <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> (1962) for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. He received seven further Oscar nominations – for <i>Becket</i> (1964), <i>The Lion in Winter</i> (1968), <i>Goodbye, Mr. Chips</i> (1969), <i>The Ruling Class</i> (1972), <i>The Stunt Man</i> (1980), <i>My Favorite Year</i> (1982) and <i>Venus</i> (2006) – and holds the record for the most Academy Award acting nominations without a win. He won four Golden Globes, a BAFTA and an Emmy, and was the recipient of an Honorary Academy Award in 2003.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_O%27Toole' >More...</a><hr><h2> Superman character and cast</h2><p>Superman, given the serial nature of comic publishing and the length of the character's existence, has evolved as a character as his adventures have increased. Initially a crime fighter, the character was seen in early adventures stepping in to stop wife beaters and gangsters, with rather rough edges and a rather looser moral code than audiences may be used to today. Modern writers have softened the character, and instilled a sense of idealism and moral code of conduct.</p>
<p>Clark Kent, initially based somewhat on Harold Lloyd, has also been updated over the years. During the 1970s, the character left the <i>Daily Planet</i> for a time to work for television, whilst the 1980s revamp by John Byrne saw the character become somewhat more aggressive. This aggressiveness has since faded with subsequent creators restoring the mild mannerisms traditional to the character. Children have often been discussed in arenas both in and outside the official comics, with the possibility of progeny a part of Bryan Singer's 2006 film <i>Superman Returns</i>.</p>
<p>Superman's powers have developed, and his adventures have accumulated, far beyond the Fleischer cartoon's intonation of a character "faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound." Initially the character could not fly, but this ability and many more have added to the character's appeal. Superman's weakness to kryptonite, now well established, was introduced quite late in the character's history, first appearing in the radio series in 1943. Superman's large cast of supporting characters includes Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Perry White, while many adventures have seen the character pitted against villains such as Lex Luthor, Brainiac, and Doomsday.</p>

Fontaine began her career on the stage in 1935 and signed a contract with RKO Pictures that same year.</p>
<p>In 1941, she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her role in <i>Rebecca</i>, directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The following year, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Hitchcock's <i>Suspicion</i> (1941) making Fontaine the only actor to ever win an Academy Award in a film directed by Hitchcock. Fontaine and her elder sister Olivia de Havilland are the only siblings to have won lead acting Academy Awards. During the 1940s to the 1990s, Fontaine continued her career in roles on the stage and in radio, television and film. She released her autobiography, <i>No Bed of Roses</i>, in 1978. After a career spanning over fifty years, Fontaine made her last on-screen appearance in 1994.</p>
<p>Born in Japan to British parents, the sisters moved to California in 1919. Fontaine lived in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, where she owned a home, Villa Fontana. It was there that she died of natural causes at the age of 96 in 2013.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Fontaine' >More...</a><hr><h2> Homeland (TV series)</h2><p><i><b>Homeland</b></i> is an American political thriller television series developed by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa based on the Israeli series <i>Hatufim</i> (English title: <i>Prisoners of War</i>) created by Gideon Raff.</p>

<p>The series is broadcast in the U.S. on the cable channel Showtime, and is produced by Fox 21. It premiered on October 2, 2011.

E. Lawrence in <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>. He went on to become one of the most honoured film and stage actors of his time.

<p>De Havilland won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performances in <i>To Each His Own</i> (1946) and <i>The Heiress</i> (1949); de Havilland and sister Fontaine are the only siblings to have won lead acting Academy Awards.

<p>Laughlin was best-known for his series of <i>Billy Jack</i> films. He was married to actress Delores Taylor from 1954 until his death. Taylor also co-produced and acted in all four of the <i>Billy Jack</i> films. His unique promotion of <i>The Trial of Billy Jack</i> (TV trailers during national news and an "opening day" nationwide release) was a major influence on the way films are marketed.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, Laughlin put his film career on hiatus to start a Montessori preschool in Santa Monica, California; it became the largest school of its kind in the United States. In his later years, he sought the office of President of the United States in 1992, 2004, and 2008. He also was involved in psychology and domestic abuse counseling, writing several books on Jungian psychology and developing theories on the causes of cancer.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Laughlin' >More...</a><hr><h2> Vanilla Ice</h2><p><b>Robert Matthew Van Winkle</b> (born October 31, 1967), better known by his stage name, <b>Vanilla Ice</b>, is an American rapper, actor and television host. Born in South Dallas, and raised in Texas and South Florida, Ice released his debut album, <i>Hooked</i>, in 1989 on Ichiban Records, before signing a contract with SBK Records, a record label of the EMI Group which released a reformatted version of the album under the title <i>To the Extreme</i>. Ice's single "Ice Ice Baby" was the first hip hop single to top the <i>Billboard</i> charts.</p>
<p>Although Vanilla Ice was successful, he later regretted his business arrangements with SBK, which had paid him to adopt a more commercial appearance to appeal to a mass audience and published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. After surviving a suicide attempt, Ice was inspired to change his musical style and lifestyle. While his later, less mainstream albums failed to chart or receive much radio airplay, Ice has had a loyal underground following. In 2009, Ice began hosting <i>The Vanilla Ice Project</i> on DIY Network. His latest album <i>WTF – Wisdom, Tenacity &amp; Focus</i> was released in August 2011. Ice is currently signed to Psychopathic Records.</p>
