		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 19 January 2014 </h1><h2> Flowers in the Attic</h2><p><i><b>Flowers in the Attic</b></i> is a 1979 novel by V.C. Andrews. It is the first book in the Dollanganger Series, and was followed by <i>Petals on the Wind</i>, <i>If There Be Thorns</i>, <i>Seeds of Yesterday</i>, and <i>Garden of Shadows</i>. The novel is written in the first person from the point of view of Cathy Dollanganger. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1987. The book was extremely popular, selling over 40 million copies worldwide.</p>

Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members, in more than 30 countries. It was the single largest infiltration of the United States government in history with up to 5,000 covert agents. This operation also exposed the Scientology plot 'Operation Freakout', because Operation Snow White was the case that initiated the US government investigation of the Church.</p>
<p>Under this program, Scientology operatives committed infiltration, wiretapping, and theft of documents in government offices, most notably those of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Eleven highly placed Church executives, including Mary Sue Hubbard (wife of founder L. Ron Hubbard and second-in-command of the organization), pleaded guilty or were convicted in federal court of obstructing justice, burglary of government offices, and theft of documents and government property. The case was <i>United States v. Mary Sue Hubbard et al.</i>, 493 F.Supp. 209 (D.D.C. 1979).</p>

<p>The film underwent several story treatments for several years, before being commissioned in 2011, with a screenplay written by Jennifer Lee, and both Chris Buck and Lee serving as directors.
