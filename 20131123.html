		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 23 November 2013 </h1><h2> Albino redwood</h2><p>An '<b>albino'</b> <b>redwood</b> is a redwood tree which is unable to produce chlorophyll, and so has white needles instead of the normal green. In order to survive it must join its roots to the roots of a normal redwood, usually the parent tree from whose base it has sprouted, from which it obtains nutrition as a parasite. Only about twenty examples are known. These can be found in both Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park and Humboldt Redwoods State Park, with eight trees in the first. The exact locations however, are not publicized to protect the rare trees. They reach a maximum height of about 20 m (66 ft).</p>
<p>Other conifers lack the ability to graft their roots, and so 'albino' mutants of other species do not survive to become sizable trees.</p>

It causes a loss of accommodation, far sightedness (hyperopia), and a deep anterior chamber. Complications include detachment of the vitreous or retina, and glaucoma.</p>
<p>Aphakic people are reported to be able to see ultraviolet wavelengths (400 nm - 300 nm) that are normally excluded by the lens. They perceive this light as whitish blue or whitish violet. This is probably because all three of the eye's color receptors are stimulated when a person sees ultraviolet wavelengths (which also happens when a person sees a combination of red, green, and blue light). Some animals, by contrast, have a fourth color receptor for ultraviolet wavelengths (see tetrachromacy). Aphakia might have had an effect on the colors perceived by artist Claude Monet, who had cataract surgery in 1923.</p>
<p>Babies are rarely born with aphakia. Occurrence most often results from surgery to remove congenital cataracts (clouding of the eyes' lens, which can block light from entering the eye and focusing clearly). Congenital cataracts usually develop as a result of infection of the fetus or genetic reasons. It is often difficult to identify the exact cause of these cataracts, especially if only one eye is affected.</p>
<p>People with aphakia have relatively small pupils and their pupils dilate to a lesser degree.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphakia' >More...</a><hr><h2> Caroline Kennedy</h2><p><b>Caroline Bouvier Kennedy</b> (born November 27, 1957) is an American author, attorney, Ambassador to Japan, and member of the Kennedy family. She is the only living child of U.S. President John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Lee "Jackie" Bouvier.</p>
<p>At the time of her father's presidency, she was a young child; after his assassination in November 1963, her family settled in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where she attended school. Kennedy graduated from Radcliffe College and worked at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she met her future husband, exhibit designer Edwin Schlossberg. She went on to receive a J.D. degree from Columbia Law School. Kennedy's professional life has spanned law and politics as well as education and charitable work. She has also acted as a spokesperson for her family's legacy and co-authored two books on civil liberties with Ellen Alderman.</p>
<p>In the 2008 presidential election, Kennedy endorsed Democratic candidate Barack Obama for President early in the primary race; she later stumped for him in Orlando, Indiana, and Ohio, served as co-chair of his Vice Presidential Search Committee, and addressed the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. After Obama's selection of then-Senator Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, Kennedy expressed interest in being appointed to Clinton's vacant Senate seat from New York, but she later withdrew from consideration, citing "personal reasons".</p>

His peak rating is 2872, the highest in history.</p>
<p>A chess prodigy, in 2004 Carlsen became a grandmaster at the age of 13 years, 148 days, making him at that time the second youngest grandmaster in history, although he has since become the third youngest. On 1 January 2010, at the age of 19 years, 32 days, he became the youngest chess player in history to be ranked world No. 1. On the January 2013 FIDE rating list, Carlsen reached an Elo rating of 2861, at that time the highest in history. In November 2013, Carlsen beat Viswanathan Anand in the World Chess Championship 2013, thus becoming the 16th undisputed world chess champion.</p>
<p>Known for his attacking style as a teenager, Carlsen later developed into a more universal player. He does not focus on opening preparation as much as other top players, and plays a variety of openings, making it harder for opponents to prepare against him. His positional mastery and endgame prowess have drawn comparisons to those of former world champions Anatoly Karpov, José Raúl Capablanca and Vasily Smyslov.</p>
