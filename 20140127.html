		<h1>Popular Pages - Monday 27 January 2014 </h1><h2> Daft Punk</h2><p><b>Daft Punk</b> is a French electronic music duo consisting of musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 1990s house movement in France and met with continued success in the years following, combining elements of house with synthpop. The duo is credited with producing songs that are considered essential in the French house scene. The group was managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records. Early in the group's career, the band members were influenced by groups including The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>Bangalter and Homem-Christo were originally in a band called Darlin', which disbanded after a short period of time, leaving the two to experiment musically on their own. The duo became Daft Punk, releasing its critically acclaimed debut album <i>Homework</i> in 1997. The 2001 release of <i>Discovery</i> was even more successful, driven by the club singles "One More Time", "Digital Love", and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger". In March 2005, the duo released the album <i>Human After All</i> to mixed reviews. However, the singles "Robot Rock" and "Technologic" achieved success in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Daft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album <i>Alive 2007</i>, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. The duo composed the score of the film <i>Tron: Legacy</i> and in 2010 released the soundtrack album of the film. In January 2013, Daft Punk left EMI Records for Sony Music Entertainment's subsidiary label Columbia, and released <i>Random Access Memories</i> in 2013 to critical acclaim. The lead single "Get Lucky" became an international success, peaking in the top 10 in 32 countries. In 2014, <i>Random Access Memories</i> garnered three Grammy wins, including Album of the Year, while "Get Lucky" received two more wins including Record of the Year.</p>
<p>Daft Punk is noted for its elaborate live stage shows, in which visual elements and effects are incorporated with the music. The group is known for its emphasis on using visual and story components associated with their musical productions. Daft Punk is also known for its use of disguises while in public and/or performing; specifically ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001. The duo rarely grant interviews or appear on television.</p>

Born and raised in Devonport, Auckland, she performed in various singing and drama classes as a child, and at the age of thirteen signed with Universal. Yelich-O'Connor adopted her stage name due to her fascination with "royals and aristocracy", but felt the name Lord was too masculine so added an 'e' to make it more feminine.</p>
<p>Her musical debut was an EP, entitled <i>The Love Club</i>, which was released in November 2012, and her first single, "Royals", debuted at number one on the New Zealand Top 40, and also reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in 2013, making her the first New Zealand solo artist to have a number one song in the United States. Her debut album, <i>Pure Heroine</i>, was released in September 2013, receiving critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide.</p>
<p>Her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades. In October 2013, she jointly won the 2013 Silver Scroll award for "Royals," which celebrates outstanding songwriting achievements in original New Zealand pop music. For the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, Lorde received four nominations, in which she won Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for "Royals."</p>

Born in Paris, he was a major Gothic Revival architect.</p>
<p>His works were largely restorative and few of his independent building designs were ever realised. Strongly contrary to the prevailing Beaux-Arts architectural trend of his time, much of his design work was largely derided by his contemporaries. He was the architect hired to design the internal structure of the Statue of Liberty, but died before the project was completed.</p>

<p>On June 4, 2013, the Recording Academy approved a number of changes recommended by its Awards &amp; Nominations Committee: a new category for Best American Song has been added to the American Music field. It is a songwriter's award, which will encompass all the subgenres in this field such as Americana, bluegrass, blues, folk and regional roots music. The Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance category was renamed Best Metal Performance and became a stand-alone category. Hard rock performances will now be screened in the Best Rock Performance category.

Its two categories will be renamed: Best Short Form Music Video will now be known as Best Music Video and Best Long Form Music Video will change into Best Music Film.

<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bangalter' >More...</a><hr><h2> Ringo Starr</h2><p><b>Ringo Starr</b> <small style="font-size:85%;">MBE</small> (born <b>Richard Starkey</b>; 7 July 1940) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. On most of the band's albums, he sang lead vocals for one song, including "With a Little Help from My Friends", "Yellow Submarine" and their cover of "Act Naturally". He also wrote the Beatles' songs "Don't Pass Me By" and "Octopus's Garden", and is credited as a co-writer of others, such as "What Goes On" and "Flying".</p>
<p>Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during his childhood, and as a result of prolonged hospitalisations, fell behind scholastically. In 1955, he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze, developing a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he cofounded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, and they earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958.</p>
<p>When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success with them in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others.</p>
<p>After their break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles, including the US number four hit "It Don't Come Easy", and the US number ones "Photograph" and "You're Sixteen". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, "Back Off Boogaloo", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album <i>Ringo</i>, which was a top 10 release in both the UK and the US.</p>
<p>Although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence, by 1975 his solo career had diminished in importance. He has been featured in a number of documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first two seasons of the children's television series <i>Thomas &amp; Friends</i> and portrayed "Mr Conductor" during the first season of the PBS children's television series <i>Shining Time Station</i>. Since 1989, he has successfully toured with 12 variations of Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band.</p>
<p>Starr's creative contribution to music has received praise from drummers such as Phil Collins and Steve Smith, who commented: "Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm ... we started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect ... His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song." In 2011, <i>Rolling Stone</i> readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Starr' >More...</a><hr><h2> Willie Nelson</h2><p><b>Willie Hugh Nelson</b> (/wɪli nɛlsən/; born April 29, 1933) is an American country music singer-songwriter, as well as an author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album <i>Shotgun Willie</i> (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of <i>Red Headed Stranger</i> (1975) and <i>Stardust</i> (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.</p>
<p>Born during the Great Depression, and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school, in 1950, he joined the Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a disc jockey in Texas radio stations and a singer in honky tonks. Nelson moved to Vancouver, Washington, where he wrote "Family Bible" and recorded the song "Lumberjack" in 1956. In 1958, he moved to Houston, Texas after signing a contract with D Records. He sang at the Esquire Ballroom weekly and he worked as a disk jockey. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including "Funny How Time Slips Away", "Hello Walls", "Pretty Paper", and "Crazy". In 1960 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price's band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, <i>...And Then I Wrote</i>. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to Austin, Texas. The rise of the popularity of hippie music in Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement, performing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters.</p>
<p>In 1973, after signing with Atlantic Records, Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as <i>Shotgun Willie</i> and <i>Phases and Stages</i>. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album, <i>Red Headed Stranger</i>. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, <i>Wanted! The Outlaws</i>, along with Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like <i>Honeysuckle Rose</i> and recording hit songs like "On the Road Again", "To All the Girls I've Loved Before", and "Pancho &amp; Lefty", he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen, along with fellow singers Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson. In 1990 Nelson's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, which claimed that he owed US $32,000,000. It was later discovered that his accountants, Price Waterhouse, did not pay Nelson's taxes for years. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1991, Nelson released <i>The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?</i>; by 1993, the profits of the double album, destined to the IRS, and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk. Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film <i>The Electric Horseman</i>, followed by other appearances in movies and on television.</p>
<p>Nelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the bio-diesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the Advisory Board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2014-01-27 11:30:26 -0500 -->
