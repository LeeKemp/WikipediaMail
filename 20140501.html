		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 01 May 2014 </h1><h2> May Day</h2><p><b>May Day</b> on May 1 is an ancient Northern Hemisphere spring festival and usually a public holiday; it is also a traditional spring holiday in many cultures. May Day coincides with International Workers' Day, and in many countries that celebrate the latter, it may be referred to as "May Day". South Dakotans love May Day and usually their teachers them candy and let them have a free day off of school. Dances, singing and cake, are usually part of the celebrations that the day includes.</p>

Over the course of several decades, he planted and tended trees on a sandbar of the river Brahmaputra turning it into a forest reserve. The forest, called Molai forest after him, is located near Kokilamukh of Jorhat, Assam, India, and encompasses an area of about 1,360 acres / 550 hectares.</p>

Several weeks before the Copenhagen Summit on climate change, an unknown individual or group breached CRU's server and copied thousands of emails and computer files to various locations on the Internet.</p>
<p>The story was first broken by climate change critics on their blogs, with columnist James Delingpole popularising the term "Climategate" to describe the controversy. Climate change critics and others denying the significance of human caused climate change argued that the emails showed that global warming was a scientific conspiracy, in which they alleged that scientists manipulated climate data and attempted to suppress critics. The accusations were rejected by the CRU, who said that the emails had been taken out of context and merely reflected an honest exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>The mainstream media picked up the story as negotiations over climate change mitigation began in Copenhagen on 7 December. Because of the timing, scientists, policy makers, and public relations experts said that the release of emails was a smear campaign intended to undermine the climate conference. In response to the controversy, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released statements supporting the scientific consensus that the Earth's mean surface temperature had been rising for decades, with the AAAS concluding "based on multiple lines of scientific evidence that global climate change caused by human activities is now underway...it is a growing threat to society."</p>
<p>Eight committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. However, the reports called on the scientists to avoid any such allegations in the future by taking steps to regain public confidence in their work, for example by opening up access to their supporting data, processing methods and software, and by promptly honouring freedom of information requests. The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged throughout the investigations.</p>

During Steinbrenner's 37-year ownership from 1973 to his death in July 2010, the longest in club history, the Yankees earned seven World Series titles and 11 pennants. His outspokenness and role in driving up player salaries made him one of the sport's most controversial figures. Steinbrenner was also involved in the Great Lakes shipping industry.</p>
<p>Known as a hands-on baseball executive, Steinbrenner earned the nickname "<b>The Boss</b>". He had a tendency to meddle in daily on-field decisions, and to hire and fire (and sometimes re-hire) managers. Former Yankees manager Dallas Green gave him the derisive nickname "Manager George". He died after suffering a heart attack in his Tampa home on the morning of July 13, 2010, the day of the 81st All-Star Game.</p>

<p>Atlético have won La Liga on nine occasions, including a league and cup double in 1996; the Copa del Rey on ten occasions; 1 Supercopa de España and 3 Copa Eva Duarte; in Europe, they won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1962, were European Cup runners-up in 1974, won the Europa League in 2010 and in 2012, and won the UEFA Super Cup in 2010 and 2012, as well as the 1974 Intercontinental Cup.</p>
<p>The club play their home games at the Vicente Calderón, which currently holds up to 54,960 spectators. In 2016, Atletico are due to move to their new home of Estadio La Peineta, which will have a capacity of 70,000.</p>
<p>Atletico's home kit is red and white vertical striped shirts, with blue shorts, accompanied by blue and red socks. This combination has been used since 1911. Nike are the kit manufacturers, the main sponsor is Azerbaijan. The club is the third most supported in Spain, behind Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. It is also one of the biggest clubs in the world in terms of number of associates (registered paying supporters), with more than 65,000 season ticket holders.</p>
<p>During their history, the club has been known by a number of nicknames, including <i>Los Colchoneros</i> ("The Mattress Makers" in English), due to their first team stripes being the same colours as old-fashioned mattresses. During the 1970s, they became known as <i>Los Indios</i>, allegedly due to the club signing several South American players after the restrictions on signing foreign players was lifted. However, there are a number of counter theories which claim they were named so because their stadium is "camped" on the river bank, or because <i>Los Indios</i> (The Indians) were the traditional enemy of <i>Los Blancos</i> (The Whites), which is the nickname of the club's city rivals, Real Madrid.</p>
