		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 10 May 2014 </h1><h2> Poisoned Pawn Variation</h2><p>The <b>Poisoned Pawn Variation</b> is any of several series of opening moves in chess in which a pawn is said to be "poisoned" because its capture can result in a positional disadvantage or loss of material. The best known of these, called the Poisoned Pawn Variation, is a line of the Sicilian Defense, Najdorf Variation that begins with the moves:</p>
<dl><dd>1. e4 c5</dd>
<dd>2. Nf3 d6</dd>
<dd>3. d4 cxd4</dd>
<dd>4. Nxd4 Nf6</dd>
<dd>5. Nc3 a6</dd>
<dd>6. Bg5 e6</dd>
<dd>7. f4 Qb6</dd>
</dl><p>after which 8.Qd2 Qxb2 usually follows, accepting the "poisoned" b2-pawn. White can also play 8.Nb3, protecting the pawn.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoned_Pawn_Variation' >More...</a><hr><h2> Champawat Tiger</h2><p>The <b>Champawat Tiger</b> was a female Bengal tiger responsible for an estimated 430 deaths in Nepal and the Kumaon area of India, mostly during the 19th century. Her attacks have been listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the highest number of fatalities from a tiger. She was shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett.</p>

The company was founded by rapper and hip-hop producer Andre "Dr. Dre" Young and Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M Records chairman Jimmy Iovine. For a period, the company was majority-owned by Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC â€” the company reduced its stake to 25% in 2012, and sold its remaining stake back in 2013; concurrently, Carlyle Group replaced HTC as a minority shareholder alongside Dr. Dre and Iovine.</p>
<p>Beats' product line has primarily focused on headphones and speakers, marketed under the <i>Beats by Dr. Dre</i> branding; in particular, its headphone line famously places a heavy emphasis on bass, which is intended to, according to Dr. Dre in advertising material, address an apparent inability for listeners to hear "all" of the music with most headphones. From 2008 through 2012, Monster Cable served as the manufacturer for all Beats products; the company's manufacturing operations have since been taken in-house. The company has also licensed audio technology to other companies for use in their own products, and expanded into the online music industry with its 2012 purchase of MOG, followed by the 2014 launch of its Beats Music service.</p>
<p>Beats' popularity was influenced primarily by its marketing practices, centring around product placement and branding deals with hip-hop and pop musicians; in 2012, NPD Group reported that Beats had a market share of 73% for headphones priced higher than $100, and was valued at $1 billion in September 2013.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Electronics' >More...</a><hr><h2> Alpheidae</h2><p><b>Alpheidae</b> is a family of caridean <b>snapping shrimp</b> characterized by having asymmetrical claws, the larger of which is typically capable of producing a loud snapping sound. Other common names of these species include <b>pistol shrimp</b> or <b>alpheid shrimp</b>.</p>
<p>The family is diverse and worldwide in distribution, consisting of about 600 species within 38 or more genera. The two most prominent genera are <i>Alpheus</i> and <i>Synalpheus</i>, with species numbering well over 250 and 100, respectively. Most snapping shrimp dig burrows and are common inhabitants of coral reefs, submerged seagrass flats and oyster reefs. While most genera and species are found in tropical and temperate coastal and marine waters, <i>Betaeus</i> inhabits cold seas and <i>Potamalpheops</i> is found only in freshwater caves.</p>
<p>When in colonies, the snapping shrimp can interfere with sonar and underwater communication. The shrimp are a major source of noise in the ocean.</p>
