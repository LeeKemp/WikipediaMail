		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 27 March 2014 </h1><h2> Infinite monkey theorem</h2><p>The <b>infinite monkey theorem</b> states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In this context, "almost surely" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and the "monkey" is not an actual monkey, but a metaphor for an abstract device that produces an endless random sequence of letters and symbols. One of the earliest instances of the use of the "monkey metaphor" is that of French mathematician Émile Borel in 1913, but the earliest instance may be even earlier. The relevance of the theorem is questionable—the probability of a universe full of monkeys typing a complete work such as Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i> is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is <i>extremely</i> low (but technically not zero).</p>
<p>Variants of the theorem include multiple and even infinitely many typists, and the target text varies between an entire library and a single sentence. The history of these statements can be traced back to Aristotle's <i>On Generation and Corruption</i> and Cicero's <i>De natura deorum</i> (On the Nature of the Gods), through Blaise Pascal and Jonathan Swift, and finally to modern statements with their iconic simians and typewriters. In the early 20th century, Émile Borel and Arthur Eddington used the theorem to illustrate the timescales implicit in the foundations of statistical mechanics.</p>

She frequently discusses issues from what she describes as a "victims' rights" standpoint, with an outspoken style that has brought her both praise and criticism. She is the host of <i>Nancy Grace</i> (2005–present), a nightly celebrity news and current affairs show on HLN, and she was the host of Court TV's <i>Closing Arguments</i> (1996–2007). She also co-wrote the book <i>Objection! — How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal Justice System.</i> She was also the arbiter of <i>Swift Justice with Nancy Grace</i> in the syndicated courtroom reality show's first season. Due to the show relocating from Atlanta, Georgia (where Grace lives), she was replaced by former Clark County District Court Judge Jackie Glass. The show was not renewed for a new season under Glass.</p>

The term zeolite was originally coined in 1756 by Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who observed that upon rapidly heating the material stilbite, it produced large amounts of steam from water that had been adsorbed by the material. Based on this, he called the material <i>zeolite</i>, from the Greek ζέω (<i>zéō</i>), meaning "to boil" and λίθος (<i>líthos</i>), meaning "stone".</p>
<p>Zeolites occur naturally but are also produced industrially on a large scale. As of October 2012, 206 unique zeolite frameworks have been identified, and over 40 naturally occurring zeolite frameworks are known.</p>
