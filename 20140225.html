		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 25 February 2014 </h1><h2> Harold Ramis</h2><p><b>Harold Allen Ramis</b> (November 21, 1944 – February 24, 2014) was an American actor, director, and writer specializing in comedy. His best-known film acting roles are as Egon Spengler in <i>Ghostbusters</i> (1984) and Russell Ziskey in <i>Stripes</i> (1981); he also co-wrote both films. As a writer-director, his films include the comedies <i>Caddyshack</i> (1980), <i>National Lampoon's Vacation</i> (1983), <i>Groundhog Day</i> (1993), and <i>Analyze This</i> (1999). Ramis was the original head writer of the television series <i>SCTV</i> (on which he also performed), and one of three screenwriters for the film <i>National Lampoon's Animal House</i> (1978).</p>
<p>Ramis' films have influenced subsequent generations of comedians and comedy writers. Filmmakers Jay Roach, Jake Kasdan, Adam Sandler, and Peter and Bobby Farrelly have cited his films as among their favorites.<br></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Ramis' >More...</a><hr><h2> Looney Tunes</h2><p><i><b>Looney Tunes</b></i> is a series of Warner Bros. animated comedy short films. It was produced from 1930 to 1969 during the golden age of American animation, alongside its sister series, <i>Merrie Melodies</i>. <i>Looney Tunes</i> originally showcased Warner-owned musical compositions through the adventures of cartoon characters such as Bosko and Buddy. Later <i>Looney Tunes</i> films featured such popular characters as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Sylvester, Tweety, Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner. The characters themselves are commonly referred to as the "Looney Tunes." The series' name is a parody of <i>Silly Symphonies</i>, the name of Walt Disney's concurrent series of music-based short films. From 1942 into the 1960s, <i>Looney Tunes</i> and <i>Merrie Melodies</i> were the most popular cartoon shorts in movie theaters, exceeding the works of Disney and other popular competitors, including Paramount's Famous Studios (originally Fleischer Studios), Universal's Walter Lantz Productions, Columbia's UPA (originally Screen Gems), 20th Century Fox's Terrytoons, and MGM.</p>
<p>Since its success during the short film era of cartoons, <i>Looney Tunes</i> has become a worldwide media franchise; spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements. The most popular <i>Looney Tunes</i> character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a cultural icon and has appeared in more films than any other cartoon character. Several <i>Looney Tunes</i> films are regarded as some of the greatest animated cartoons of all time.</p>
<p>In 2013, TV Guide ranked <i>Looney Tunes</i> the third Greatest Cartoon of All Time (out of 60).</p>

Both arteries and veins are affected. Lymphangitis is sometimes considered a type of vasculitis. Vasculitis is primarily due to leukocyte migration and resultant damage.</p>
<p>Although both occur in vasculitis, inflammation of veins (phlebitis) or arteries (arteritis) on their own are separate entities.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis' >More...</a><hr><h2> Berenstain Bears</h2><p><b>The Berenstain Bears</b> is a series of children's books created by Stan and Jan Berenstain and continued by their son, Mike Berenstain. The books feature a family of anthropomorphic bears who generally learn a moral or safety-related lesson in the course of each story. Since the 1962 debut of the first Berenstain Bears book, <i>The Big Honey Hunt</i>, the series has grown to over 300 titles, which have sold approximately 260 million copies in 23 languages. The Berenstain Bears franchise has also expanded well beyond the books, encompassing two television series and a wide variety of other products and licenses. While enjoying decades of popularity, the series has been criticized for its perceived saccharine tone and formulaic storytelling.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenstain_Bears' >More...</a><hr><h2> Ghostbusters</h2><p><i><b>Ghostbusters</b></i> is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The film stars Bill Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as three eccentric parapsychologists in New York City who start a ghost catching business. Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis co-star as a potential client and her neighbor. The Ghostbusters business booms after some initial skepticism, but when an uptown high-rise apartment building becomes the focal point of spirit activity linked to the ancient god Gozer, the problem threatens to overwhelm the team and the entire world.</p>
<p>Originally intended by Aykroyd as a project for himself and fellow <i>Saturday Night Live</i> alumnus John Belushi, the film had a very different story during initial drafts. Aykroyd's vision of "Ghostmashers" traveling through time, space, and other dimensions to fight large ghosts was deemed financially impractical by Reitman. Based on the director's suggestions, Aykroyd and Ramis finalized the screenplay from May–June 1982. They had written roles specifically for Belushi, John Candy, and Eddie Murphy, but were forced to change the script after Belushi died and the latter two actors would not commit to the film.</p>
<p>Released in the United States on June 8, 1984, <i>Ghostbusters</i> was a critical success, receiving a positive response from critics and audiences, while grossing US$238 million in the United States and more than $291 million worldwide. The film was nominated for two Oscars at the 57th Academy Awards ceremony for Best Visual Effects and Best Original Song (for the eponymous theme song), but lost both to <i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</i> and <i>The Woman in Red</i> respectively. The American Film Institute ranked <i>Ghostbusters</i> 28th in its <i>AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs</i> list of film comedies. The film launched the <i>Ghostbusters</i> media franchise, which includes: a 1989 sequel, <i>Ghostbusters II</i>; two animated television series, <i>The Real Ghostbusters</i> and <i>Extreme Ghostbusters</i>; and several video games.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters' >More...</a><hr><h2> Complete blood count</h2><p>A <b>complete blood count</b> (<b>CBC</b>), also known as <b>full blood count</b> (<b>FBC</b>) or <b>full blood exam</b> (<b>FBE</b>) or <b>blood panel</b>, is a test panel requested by a doctor or other medical professional that gives information about the cells in a patient's blood. A scientist or lab technician performs the requested testing and provides the requesting medical professional with the results of the CBC.</p>
<p>Blood counts of various types have been used for clinical purposes since the 19th century. Automated equipment to carry out complete blood counts was developed in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>The cells that circulate in the bloodstream are generally divided into three types: white blood cells (leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). Abnormally high or low counts may indicate the presence of many forms of disease, and hence blood counts are amongst the most commonly performed blood tests in medicine, as they can provide an overview of a patient's general health status. A CBC is routinely performed during annual physical examinations in some jurisdictions.</p>
