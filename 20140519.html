Durning's memorable roles included the Oscar-winning <i>The Sting</i> (1973) and <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i> (1975), along with the comedies <i>Tootsie</i> (1982), and <i>The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</i> (1982) and <i>To Be or Not to Be</i> (1983).</p>

She relocated to the United States at the age of 16, first staying in Miami, Florida, and then other parts of the South, including Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. She first gained recognition after the respective music videos for her controversial songs "Pussy" and "Two Times" went viral on YouTube. On 27 September 2011, Azalea released her first full-length project, a mixtape entitled <i>Ignorant Art</i>, saying she made it "with the intent to make people question and redefine old ideals." In 2012, she announced her signing to Mercury Records and the following year to Island Def Jam. Azalea went into professional modeling, when she became represented by Wilhelmina Models, in the spring of 2012; later that year she was announced the "New Face of Levi Jeans".</p>
<p>In 2012, Azalea became the first female and non-American rapper to be featured on <i>XXL</i> magazine's annual Top 10 Freshman cover issue. On 30 July 2012, she released <i>Glory</i>, her debut extended play (EP), which was executive produced by American rapper and Grand Hustle label-boss T.I.. The EP was composed of songs originally meant to appear on Azalea's long-awaited and often-delayed debut album. On 11 October 2012, she released her second mixtape <i>TrapGold</i>, which was produced entirely by high-profile producer Diplo, as well as 1st Down of production team FKi. The mixtape is significant for foreshadowing Azalea's new approach to music and her later work, which heavily includes electronic elements. <sup style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>check quotation syntax</i>]</sup> Azalea's debut studio album <i>The New Classic</i> was released on 21 April 2014. Initially set to be released with Grand Hustle and Interscope Records, after label conflicts, in 2013 Azalea finally secured a deal with Mercury Records and later Island Def Jam, to release her debut album. The album was preceded by the lead single and Azalea's commercial debut single "Work", which successfully charted on several international music charts and peaked at No. 17 on the UK Singles Chart. The other three singles released in promotion for the album were "Bounce", "Change Your Life" and "Fancy", with the latter two featuring guest appearances from T.I. and Charli XCX, respectively.</p>

Adelson, Professor of Vision Science at MIT in 1995. The image depicts a checkerboard with light and dark squares. The optical illusion is that the area of the image labeled A appears to be a darker color than the area of the image labeled B. However, they are actually exactly the same color.</p>
<p>This can be proven using the following methods:</p>
<ul><li>Opening the illusion in an image editing program and using the eyedropper tool to verify that the colors are the same</li>
<li>Isolating the squares. Without the surrounding context, the effect of the illusion is dispelled. This can be done by using the selection tool in some image editing programs.</li>
<li>Using a photometer</li>
<li>Connecting the squares with a rectangle of the same color, as seen below in the middle figure.</li>
