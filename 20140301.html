		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 01 March 2014 </h1><h2> Autotomy</h2><p><b>Autotomy</b> (from the Greek <i>auto</i> meaning "self-" and <i>tomy</i> meaning "severing") or <b>self amputation</b> is the behaviour whereby an animal sheds or discards one or more of its own appendages, usually as a self-defense mechanism to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be regenerated later.</p>

It uses a context-free grammar to form all elements of the papers, and its authors state that their aim is "to maximize amusement, rather than coherence."</p>

Many of these songs were written in the late 1990s, though the song "Silver &amp; Gold," which by his own estimation, he had been trying to get "the take" for around ten years, was written in 1981.</p>
<p>Musically, the album is a return to the previous country/roots tinged material of earlier records such as <i>Harvest</i> and <i>Comes a Time</i>; however, the lyrics suggest an artist becoming more in touch with his familial leanings, growing older, and becoming more complete as a person. Young looks back over his life and career with a warm, nostalgic view, even going so far as to state that he wouldn't mind a Buffalo Springfield reunion: He wistfully sings, "Like to see those guys again/And give it a shot," in the song "Buffalo Springfield Again." The tone of the album is quiet and peaceful.</p>
<p>The album was a nominee for Roots &amp; Traditional Album of the Year – Solo at the 2001 Juno Awards.</p>
<p>The album art is a photo taken by Neil's daughter Amber with a Game Boy Camera.</p>

Accounts of the tale appear in three texts: <i>Toen shōsetsu</i> (1825), <i>Hyōryū kishū</i> (1835) and <i>Ume-no-chiri</i> (1844).</p>
<p>According to legend, an attractive young woman arrived on a local beach aboard the "hollow ship". Fishermen brought her inland to investigate further, but the woman was unable to communicate in Japanese. The fishermen then returned her and her vessel to the sea, where it drifted away.</p>
<p>Historians, ethnologists and physicists such as Kazuo Tanaka and Yanagita Kunio have evaluated the "legend of the hollow boat" as part of a long-standing tradition within Japanese folklore. Alternately, certain ufologists have claimed that the story represents evidence for a close encounter of the third kind.</p>

He also stars in the animated television series based on the film. In all animated appearances, Aladdin is voiced by American actor Scott Weinger, while his singing voice is provided by Brad Kane.</p>
<p>When Aladdin is introduced initially, he is 18 years old. He never received a formal education, and has only learned by being on the streets of Agrabah. He steals to survive, making him a sort of Robin Hood-type thief. Aladdin was born 18 years prior to the events in the first film. He was born to Cassim and his wife. When Aladdin was only an infant, his father left him and his mother in order to find a better life for his family. When Aladdin was two, his mother was captured by bandits and was presumed dead. Aladdin's parents were too poor to provide clothing for their son. When Aladdin was seven, he had his first encounter with Razoul, the new captain of the Sultan's guard. Aladdin had stolen an apple from a fruit stand.</p>
<p>Initially, the boy managed to outmaneuver the guards. Eventually, he was apprehended and sentenced to detention within the palace dungeon. However, he managed to escape by picking the locks to his chains. When he was twelve, he stole a vest, a pair of pants, and a fez from a clothes line. When he was sixteen he fell in with a group of circus performers, one of whom was the monkey Abu.</p>

David was a native of Wales, and a relatively large amount of information is known about his life. However, his birth date is still uncertain, as suggestions range from 462 to 512. The Welsh annals place his death 569 years after the birth of Christ, but Phillimore's dating revised this to 601.</p>

<p>In a 1976 study, Gwen Broude and Sarah Greene compared attitudes towards and frequency of homosexuality in the ethnographic studies available in the Standard cross-cultural sample. They found that out of 42 communities: homosexuality was accepted or ignored in 9; 5 communities had no concept of homosexuality; 11 considered it undesirable but did not set punishments; and 17 strongly disapproved and punished. Of 70 communities, homosexuality was reported to be absent or rare in frequency in 41, and present or not uncommon in 29.</p>
<p>In cultures influenced by Abrahamic religions, the law and the church established sodomy as a transgression against divine law or a crime against nature. The condemnation of anal sex between males, however, predates Christian belief. It was frequent in ancient Greece; "unnatural" can be traced back to Plato.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>clarification needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p>Many historical figures, including Socrates, Lord Byron, Edward II, and Hadrian, have had terms such as <i>gay</i> or <i>bisexual</i> applied to them; some scholars, such as Michel Foucault, have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary social construct of sexuality foreign to their times, though others challenge this.</p>
<p>A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. John Boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato, which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_homosexuality' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2014-03-01 11:30:11 -0500 -->
