<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Plummer' >More...</a><hr><h2> Mar Menor</h2><p><b>Mar Menor</b> (<small>Spanish pronunciation: </small>[ˈmar meˈnor], "Minor sea") is a salty lagoon, in the south-east of the autonomous community of Murcia, in Spain, separated from the Mediterranean sea by La Manga, a sandbar 22km in length and with a width ranging from 100 to 1200 m.</p>
<p>It belongs to four municipalities: Cartagena, Los Alcázares, San Javier and San Pedro del Pinatar. With a surface area of nearly 170km², a coastal length of 70km, and warm and clear water no more than 7 m in depth, it is <i>"the largest swimming pool in the world"</i>, in the opinion of famous swimmer and Hollywood actress Esther Williams.</p>
<p>Its relatively high salinity, which aids flotation, and remarkable sporting infrastructures make this one of the most popular places in Europe for a wide variety of water sports.</p>
<p>First the Phoenicians and then the Moorish kings, chose this "small sea" as the site of their summer residences. Today, this area attracts all those who seek a quiet place to rest and relax, with ideal weather conditions all year round.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Menor' >More...</a><hr><h2> Niihau</h2><p><b>Niʻihau</b> or <b>Niihau</b> (/ˈniːhaʊ/; Hawaiian: [ˈniʔiˈhɔu]) is the seventh largest of the inhabited Hawaiian Islands in the U.S. state of Hawaiʻi, having an area of 69.5 square miles (180 km<sup>2</sup>). Niʻihau lies 17.5 miles (15.2 nmi; 28.2 km) southwest of Kauaʻi across the Kaulakahi Channel. Several intermittent playa lakes provide wetland habitats for the Hawaiian Coot, the Black-winged Stilt, and the Hawaiian Duck. The island is designated as critical habitat for <i>Brighamia insignis</i>, an endemic and endangered species of Hawaiian lobelioid. The United States Census Bureau defines Niʻihau and the neighboring island and State Seabird Sanctuary of Lehua as Census Tract 410 of Kauai County, Hawaii. Its 2000 census population was 160; As of June 2009, the population was 130.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Sinclair purchased Niʻihau in 1864 from the Kingdom of Hawaii and private ownership passed on to her descendants, the Robinson family. During World War II, the island was the site of the Niʻihau Incident: A Japanese navy fighter pilot crashed on the island and terrorized its residents for a week after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The people of Niʻihau are known for their gemlike <i>lei pūpū</i> (shell lei) craftsmanship, and speak Hawaiian as a primary language. The island is generally off-limits to all but relatives of the island's owners, U.S. Navy personnel, government officials and invited guests, giving it the nickname "The Forbidden Isle." Beginning in 1987, a limited number of supervised activity tours and hunting safaris have opened to tourists. The island is currently managed by Bruce and Keith Robinson.</p>

Netflix had ordered two seasons of 13 episodes when it made its original commitment to the series in 2011. Filming for the season commenced April 29, 2013 and concluded on November 8, occurring primarily in Baltimore. On December 4, 2013, Netflix announced that the season will be released in its entirety on February 14, 2014. During the season Francis is the newly appointed Vice President of the United States.</p>
<p>Critics previewed the first four episodes of the season under non-disclosure agreements that they consented to embargo spoiler content. Reviews began appearing as early as January 31. Many critics who previewed the season noted the shocking first episode, but withheld the surprises of the four episodes made available for preview. However, at least one critic (Willa Paskin of <i>Slate</i>) broke the embargo nearly a day early revealing several spoilers. Whereas critics had been somewhat split on the propriety of bingewatching season 1, they were more supportive of the practice for season 2.</p>
<p>Early reviews were largely positive. The season was regarded as darker than season 1. Molly Parker was praised as an addition to the cast. Nonetheless, many critics were concerned at the domineering presence of Underwood who appears to have no worthy adversaries.</p>

He is the creator of the comic strip <i>Life in Hell</i> (1977–2012) as well as two successful television series, <i>The Simpsons</i> (1989–present) and <i>Futurama</i> (1999–2003, 2008–2013).</p>
<p>Groening made his first professional cartoon sale of <i>Life in Hell</i> to the avant-garde <i>Wet</i> magazine in 1978. At its peak, the cartoon was carried in 250 weekly newspapers. <i>Life in Hell</i> caught the attention of James L. Brooks. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the Fox variety show <i>The Tracey Ullman Show</i>. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his <i>Life in Hell</i> characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family, Matt Groening's Simpsons family, and named the members after his own parents and sisters—while Bart was an anagram of the word brat. The shorts would be spun off into their own series: <i>The Simpsons</i>, which has since aired 541 episodes. In 1997, Groening and former <i>Simpsons</i> writer David X. Cohen developed <i>Futurama</i>, an animated series about life in the year 3000, which premiered in 1999. After four years on the air, the show was canceled by Fox in 2003, but Comedy Central commissioned 16 new episodes from four direct-to-DVD movies in 2008. Then, in June 2009, Comedy Central ordered 26 new episodes of <i>Futurama</i>, to be aired over two seasons.</p>
<p>Groening has won 12 Primetime Emmy Awards, ten for <i>The Simpsons</i> and two for <i>Futurama</i> as well as a British Comedy Award for "outstanding contribution to comedy" in 2004. In 2002, he won the National Cartoonist Society Reuben Award for his work on <i>Life in Hell</i>. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 14, 2012.</p>
