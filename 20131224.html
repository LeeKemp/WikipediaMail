		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 24 December 2013 </h1><h2> Stephen Amell</h2><p><b>Stephen Amell</b> (born May 8, 1981) is a Canadian actor. He is perhaps best known for portraying Oliver Queen in The CW series <i>Arrow</i>.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Amell' >More...</a><hr><h2> Timothy Leary</h2><p><b>Timothy Francis Leary</b> (October 22, 1920 – May 31, 1996) was an American psychologist and writer, known for his advocacy of psychedelic drugs. During a time when drugs such as LSD and psilocybin were legal, Leary conducted experiments at Harvard University under the Harvard Psilocybin Project, resulting in the Concord Prison Experiment and the Marsh Chapel Experiment. Both studies produced useful data<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup>, but Leary and his associate Richard Alpert were fired from the university nonetheless because of the public controversy surrounding their research.</p>
<p>Leary believed LSD showed therapeutic potential for use in psychiatry. He popularized catchphrases that promoted his philosophy such as "turn on, tune in, drop out" (a phrase given to Leary by Marshall McLuhan); "set and setting"; and "think for yourself and question authority". He also wrote and spoke frequently about transhumanist concepts involving space migration, intelligence increase and life extension (SMI²LE), and developed the eight-circuit model of consciousness in his book <i>Exo-Psychology</i> (1977).</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s, he was arrested often enough to see the inside of 29 different prisons worldwide. President Richard Nixon once described Leary as "the most dangerous man in America".</p>

Thompson's rise to fame in the 1970s and his relationship with Chicano attorney and activist Oscar Zeta Acosta. Art Linson directed the picture, while Bill Murray portrayed the author and Peter Boyle portrayed Acosta, who is referred to in the film as Carl Lazlo, Esq. A number of other names, places, and details of Thompson's life are also changed.</p>
<p>Thompson's obituary for Acosta, "The Banshee Screams for Buffalo Meat," which appeared in <i>Rolling Stone</i> in October 1977, serves as the basis of the film, although screenplay writer John Kaye drew from several other works, including <i>Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72</i>, <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i>, and <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>. Thompson served as "executive consultant" on the film.</p>

<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Kalashnikov' >More...</a><hr><h2> Festivus</h2><p><b>Festivus</b>, a well-celebrated parody, has become a secular holiday celebrated on December 23 which serves as an alternative to participating in the pressures and commercialism of the Christmas holiday season. Originally a family tradition of scriptwriter Dan O'Keefe, who worked on the American sitcom <i>Seinfeld</i>, the holiday entered popular culture after it was made the focus of a 1997 episode of the program. The holiday's celebration, as it was shown on <i>Seinfeld</i>, includes a Festivus dinner, an unadorned aluminum Festivus pole, practices such as the "Airing of Grievances" and "Feats of Strength," and the labeling of easily explainable events as "Festivus miracles."</p>
<p>The episode refers to it as "a Festivus for the rest of us", referencing its non-commercial aspect. It has also been described as a "parody holiday festival" and as a form of playful consumer resistance.</p>
<p>Some atheists celebrate Festivus, and have joined other celebrants in erecting Festivus poles alongside public displays of the Nativity scene of Christmas and the menorah of Hanukkah.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus' >More...</a><hr><h2> AK-47</h2><p>The <b>AK-47</b> is a selective-fire, gas-operated 7.62×39mm assault rifle, first developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is officially known as <i>Avtomat Kalashnikova</i> (Russian: <b>А</b>втомат <b>К</b>алашникова). It is also known as <b>Kalashnikov</b>, <b>AK</b>, or in Russian slang, <b>Kalash</b>.</p>
<p>Design work on the AK-47 began in the last year of World War II (1945). After the war in 1946, the AK-46 was presented for official military trials. In 1948 the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the Soviet Army. An early development of the design was the <b>AKS</b> (S—<i>Skladnoy</i> or "folding"), which was equipped with an underfolding metal shoulder stock. In 1949, the AK-47 was officially accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces and used by the majority of the member states of the Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>The original AK-47 was one of the first assault rifles of 2nd generation, after the German StG 44. Even after six decades the model and its variants remain the most widely used and popular assault rifles in the world because of their durability, low production cost, availability, and ease of use. It has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces worldwide. The AK-47 was the basis for developing many other types of individual and crew-served firearms. More AK-type rifles have been produced than all other assault rifles combined.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-47' >More...</a><hr><h2> Alan Turing</h2><p><b>Alan Mathison Turing</b>, OBE, FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/ <i><b>TEWR</b>-ing</i>; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954), was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and computer scientist. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, giving a formalisation of the concepts of "algorithm" and "computation" with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time he was head of Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the method of the bombe, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.</p>
<p>After the war, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the ACE, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Laboratory at Manchester University, where he assisted in the development of the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, which were first observed in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Turing's homosexuality resulted in a criminal prosecution in 1952, when homosexual acts were still criminalized in the United Kingdom. He accepted treatment with female hormones (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, just over two weeks before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined that his death was suicide; his mother and some others believed his death was accidental. On 10 September 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated." In May 2012, a private member's bill was put before the House of Lords to grant Turing a statutory pardon. In July 2013 it gained government support and the royal prerogative of mercy was granted on 23 December 2013.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing' >More...</a><hr><h2> Santa Claus</h2><p><b>Santa Claus</b>, also known as <b>Saint Nicholas</b>, <b>Father Christmas</b>, <b>Kris Kringle</b> and simply "<b>Santa</b>", is a mythical, fictitious figure with legendary, historical and folkloric origins who, in many Western cultures, is said to bring gifts to the homes of the good children on December 24, the night before Christmas. However, in some European countries children receive their presents on St. Nicholas' Day, December 6. The modern figure of Santa Claus is derived from the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas, which, in turn, has part of its basis in hagiographical tales concerning the historical figure of Christian bishop and gift-giver Saint Nicholas. During the Christianization of Germanic Europe, this figure may have absorbed elements of the god Odin, who was associated with the Germanic pagan midwinter event of Yule and led the Wild Hunt, a ghostly procession through the sky. Over time, traits of this character and the British folklore character Father Christmas merged to form the modern Santa Claus known today.</p>
<p>Santa Claus is generally depicted as a portly, joyous, white-bearded man—sometimes with spectacles—wearing a red coat with white collar and cuffs, white-cuffed red trousers, and black leather belt and boots and who carries a bag full of gifts for children. Images of him rarely have a beard with no moustache. This image became popular in the United States and Canada in the 19th century due to the significant influence of the 1823 poem "A Visit From St. Nicholas" and of caricaturist and political cartoonist Thomas Nast. This image has been maintained and reinforced through song, radio, television, children's books and films.</p>
<p>Since the 20th century, in an idea popularized by the 1934 song "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town", Santa Claus has been believed to make a list of children throughout the world, categorizing them according to their behavior ("naughty" or "nice") and to deliver presents, including toys, and candy to all of the well-behaved children in the world, and sometimes coal to the naughty children, on the single night of Christmas Eve. He accomplishes this feat with the aid of the elves who make the toys in the workshop and the flying reindeer who pull his sleigh.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus' >More...</a><hr><h2> Polaris</h2><p><b>Polaris</b> (α UMi, α Ursae Minoris, Alpha Ursae Minoris, commonly North Star, Northern Star or Pole Star, also Lodestar, sometimes Guiding star) is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star.</p>
<p>It is a multiple star, consisting of the main star α UMi Aa, two smaller companions, α UMi B and α UMi Ab, and two distant components α UMi C and α UMi D. α UMi B was discovered in 1780 by William Herschel.</p>
<p>Many recent papers calculate the distance to Polaris at about 434 light-years (133 parsecs). Some suggest it may be 30% closer which, if correct, is especially notable because Polaris is the closest Cepheid variable to Earth so its physical parameters are of critical importance to the whole astronomical distance scale.</p>
