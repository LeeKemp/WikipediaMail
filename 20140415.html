		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 15 April 2014 </h1><h2> Göbekli Tepe</h2><p><b>Göbekli Tepe</b> (<small>Turkish: </small>[ɡøbe̞kli te̞pɛ], "Potbelly Hill") is an archaeological site at the top of a mountain ridge in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey, northeast of the town of Şanlıurfa. The tell has a height of 15 m (49 ft) and is about 300 m (984 ft) in diameter. It is approximately 760 m (2,493 ft) above sea level. It has been excavated by a German archaeological team that has been under the direction of Klaus Schmidt since 1996.</p>
<p>The tell includes two phases of ritual use dating back to the 10th-8th millennium BC. During the first phase (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)), circles of massive T-shaped stone pillars were erected. More than 200 pillars in about 20 circles are currently known through geophysical surveys. Each pillar has a height of up to 6 m (20 ft) and a weight of up to 20 tons. They are fitted into sockets that were hewn out of the bedrock. In the second phase (Pre-pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)), the erected pillars are smaller and stood in rectangular rooms with floors of polished lime. The site was abandoned after the PPNB-period. Younger structures date to classical times.</p>
<p>The function of the structures is not yet clear. The most common opinion, shared by excavator Klaus Schmidt, is that they are early neolithic sanctuaries.</p>

This can occur only when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned (in "syzygy") exactly, or very closely so, with the Earth in the middle. Hence, a lunar eclipse can only occur the night of a full moon. The type and length of an eclipse depend upon the Moon's location relative to its orbital nodes.</p>
<p>Unlike a solar eclipse, which can only be viewed from a certain relatively small area of the world, a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of the Earth. A lunar eclipse lasts for a few hours, whereas a total solar eclipse lasts for only a few minutes at any given place, due to the smaller size of the moon's shadow. Also unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view without any eye protection or special precautions, as they are dimmer than the full moon.</p>
<p>For the date of the next eclipse see the section <i>Recent and forthcoming lunar eclipses</i>.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse' >More...</a><hr><h2> April 2014 lunar eclipse</h2><p>A total lunar eclipse took place on 15 April 2014. It is the former of two total lunar eclipses in 2014, and the first in a tetrad (four total lunar eclipses in series). Subsequent eclipses in the tetrad are those of 8 October 2014, 4 April 2015, and 28 September 2015.</p>
<p>The eclipse was visible in the Pacific Ocean region, including Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Americas. The moon passed south of the center of the Earth's shadow. As a result, the northern part of the moon was noticeably darker than the southern part. It occurred during the ascending phase of the moon's orbit, part of lunar saros 122.</p>

The Jewish people celebrate Passover as a commemoration of their liberation over 3,300 years ago by God from slavery in ancient Egypt that was ruled by the Pharaohs, and their freedom as a nation under the leadership of Moses. It commemorates the story of the Exodus as described in the Hebrew Bible especially in the Book of Exodus, in which the Israelites were freed from slavery in Egypt.</p>
<p>Passover commences on the 15th of the Hebrew month of Nisan and lasts for either seven days (in Israel) or eight days (in the diaspora). In Judaism, a day commences at dusk and lasts until the following dusk, thus the first day of Passover only begins <i>after</i> dusk of the 14th of Nisan and ends at dusk of the 15th day of the month of Nisan. The rituals unique to the Passover celebrations commence with the Passover Seder when the 15th of Nisan has begun. In the Northern Hemisphere Passover takes place in spring as the Torah prescribes it: "in the month of [the] spring" (בחדש האביב Exodus 23:15). It is one of the most widely observed Jewish holidays.</p>
<p>In the narrative of the Exodus, the Bible tells that God helped the Children of Israel escape from their slavery in Egypt by inflicting ten plagues upon the ancient Egyptians before the Pharaoh would release his Israelite slaves; the tenth and worst of the plagues was the death of the Egyptian first-born.</p>
<p>The Israelites were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a slaughtered spring lamb and, upon seeing this, the spirit of the Lord knew to <i>pass over</i> the first-born in these homes, hence the English name of the holiday.</p>
<p>When the Pharaoh freed the Israelites, it is said that they left in such a hurry that they could not wait for bread dough to rise (leaven). In commemoration, for the duration of Passover no leavened bread is eaten, for which reason Passover was called the feast of unleavened bread in the Torah or Old Testament. Thus <i>Matzo</i> (flat unleavened bread) is eaten during Passover and it is a tradition of the holiday.</p>
<p>Historically, together with Shavuot ("Pentecost") and Sukkot ("Tabernacles"), Passover is one of the three pilgrimage festivals (<i>Shalosh Regalim</i>) during which the entire population of the kingdom of Judah made a pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem. Samaritans still make this pilgrimage to Mount Gerizim, but only men participate in public worship.</p>

His original fields were nuclear and elementary particle physics but branched out into applications of physics in other disciplines and brings the rigor of physics into the new field of Risk Analysis. Most of his career he has been a physics professor at Harvard University.</p>

This vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check in the handling of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) heartbeat extension. A fixed version of OpenSSL was released on April 7, 2014, at the same time as Heartbleed was publicly disclosed. At that time, some 17 percent (around half a million) of the Internet's secure web servers certified by trusted authorities were believed to be vulnerable to the attack, allowing theft of the servers' private keys and users' session cookies and passwords. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Ars Technica, and Bruce Schneier all deemed the Heartbleed bug "catastrophic". <i>Forbes</i> cybersecurity columnist Joseph Steinberg wrote, "Some might argue that [Heartbleed] is the worst vulnerability found (at least in terms of its potential impact) since commercial traffic began to flow on the Internet."</p>
<p>A United States Cabinet spokesman recommended that "People should take advice on changing passwords from the websites they use... Most websites have corrected the bug and are best placed to advise what action, if any, people need to take." On the day of disclosure, the Tor Project advised anyone seeking "strong anonymity or privacy on the Internet" to "stay away from the Internet entirely for the next few days while things settle."</p>
<p>Heartbleed is registered in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures system as CVE-2014-0160. The federal Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre issued a security bulletin advising system administrators about the bug.</p>

<p><b>Koch Industries, Inc.</b> /ˈkoʊk/ is an American multinational corporation based in Wichita, Kansas, United States, with subsidiaries involved in manufacturing, trading and investments. Koch also owns Invista, Georgia-Pacific, Flint Hills Resources, Koch Pipeline, Koch Fertilizer, Koch Minerals and Matador Cattle Company. Koch companies are involved in core industries such as the manufacturing, refining and distribution of petroleum, chemicals, energy, fiber, intermediates and polymers, minerals, fertilizers, pulp and paper, chemical technology equipment, ranching, finance,<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> commodities trading, as well as other ventures and investments. The firm employs 50,000 people in the United States and another 20,000 in 59 other countries.</p>
<p>In 2013, <i>Forbes</i> called it the second largest privately held company in the United States (after Cargill), with an annual revenue of $115 billion, down from the largest in 2006. If Koch Industries were a public company in 2013, it would have ranked 17 in the Fortune 500.</p>
<p>Fred C. Koch, after whom Koch Industries, Inc. is named, co-founded the company in 1940 and developed an innovative crude oil refining process. His sons, Charles Koch, chairman of the board and chief executive officer, and David H. Koch, executive vice president, are principal owners of the company after they bought out their brothers, Frederick and William "Bill" Koch, for $1.1 billion in 1983. Charles and David H. Koch each own 42% of Koch Industries, and Charles has stated that the company will publicly offer shares "literally over my dead body".</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_Industries' >More...</a><hr><h2> Bharattherium</h2><p><i><b>Bharattherium</b></i> is a mammal that lived in India during the Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous). The genus has a single species, <i><b>Bharattherium bonapartei</b></i>. It is part of the gondwanathere family Sudamericidae, which is also found in Madagascar and South America during the latest Cretaceous. The first fossil of <i>Bharattherium</i> was discovered in 1989 and published in 1997, but the animal was not named until 2007, when two teams independently named the animal <i>Bharattherium bonapartei</i> and <i>Dakshina jederi</i>. The latter name is now a synonym. <i>Bharattherium</i> is known from a total of eight isolated fossil teeth, including one incisor and seven molariforms (molar-like teeth, either premolars or true molars).</p>
<p><i>Bharattherium</i> molariforms are high, curved teeth, with a height of 5.97 to 8.40 mm. In a number of teeth tentatively identified as fourth lower molariforms (mf4), there is a large furrow on one side and a deep cavity (infundibulum) in the middle of the tooth. Another tooth, perhaps a third lower molariform, has two furrows on one side and three infundibula on the other. The tooth enamel has traits that have been interpreted as protecting against cracks in the teeth. The hypsodont (high-crowned) teeth of sudamericids like <i>Bharattherium</i> are reminiscent of later grazing mammals, and the discovery of grass in Indian fossil sites contemporaneous with those yielding <i>Bharattherium</i> suggest that sudamericids were indeed grazers.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharattherium' >More...</a><hr><h2> A Song of Ice and Fire</h2><p><i><b>A Song of Ice and Fire</b></i> is a series of epic fantasy novels written by American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin. Martin began the first volume of the series, <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, in 1991. He published it in 1996. Martin gradually extended his originally intended trilogy to seven volumes, the fifth of which, <i>A Dance with Dragons</i>, took him five years to write before its publication in 2011. Martin's work on his sixth, <i>The Winds of Winter</i>, is still underway.</p>
<p>The story of <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos, with a history of thousands of years. The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of an assortment of characters that grows from nine, in the first, to thirty-one by the fifth novel. Three predominant stories interweave: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros; the rising threat of the dormant cold supernatural Others dwelling beyond an immense wall of ice on Westeros' northern border; and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the exiled daughter of a king murdered in a civil war shortly before her birth, to return to Westeros with her fire-breathing dragons and take the iron throne which is apparently hers by 'right'.</p>
<p>Martin defied the conventions of the high fantasy genre by drawing upon such historical events as the Wars of the Roses. He drew particular inspiration from the French historical novel series <i>The Accursed Kings</i>, set in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and later wrote the introduction to the English translation of the series, saying: "<i>The Accursed Kings</i> has it all. Believe me, the Starks and the Lannisters have nothing on the Capets and Plantagenets. It is the original game of thrones". <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> received favorable critique for its diverse portrayal of women and religion, and praise for favoring realism over magic in its battles and political intrigue. While the first novel contains hardly any magic at all, the prominence of magic grows in the later volumes. The assortment of disparate, subjective, and not always accurate points of view confronts the reader with a variety of perspectives on each of the other characters from one chapter to the next. The reader may not safely presume that a favorite prominent character will prevail, or even survive. Violence, sexuality and moral ambiguity frequently arise among a set of over a thousand named characters.</p>
<p>Though initially published without great fanfare, the books have sold more than 24 million copies in North America alone as of September 2013, and have been translated into more than 20 languages. The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of <i>The New York Times</i> Best Seller lists upon their releases. Among the many derived works are three prequel novellas in a series and another further historical prequel, the HBO TV series <i>Game of Thrones</i>, a comic book adaptation, and several card, board, and video games.</p>
