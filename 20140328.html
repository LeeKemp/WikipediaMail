		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 28 March 2014 </h1><h2> Triceratops</h2><p><i><b>Triceratops</b></i> (Greek for "three-horn face") is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur that first appeared during the late Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous period, about 68 million years ago (Mya) in what is now North America. It is one of the last known non-avian dinosaur genera, and became extinct in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. The term <i>Triceratops</i>, which literally means "three-horned face", is derived from the Greek τρί- (<i>tri-</i>) meaning "three", κέρας (<i>kéras</i>) meaning "horn", and ὤψ (<i>ops</i>) meaning "face".</p>
<p>Bearing a large bony frill and three horns on its large four-legged body, and conjuring similarities with the modern rhinoceros, <i>Triceratops</i> is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best known ceratopsid. It shared the landscape with and was probably preyed upon by the fearsome <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, though it is less certain that the two did battle in the manner often depicted in traditional museum displays and popular images.</p>
<p>The exact placement of the <i>Triceratops</i> genus within the ceratopsid group has been debated by paleontologists. Two species, <i>T. horridus</i> and <i>T. prorsus</i>, are considered valid although many other species have been named. Research published in 2010 suggests that the contemporaneous <i>Torosaurus</i>, a ceratopsid long regarded as a separate genus, represents <i>Triceratops</i> in its mature form, a view not accepted by everyone. A study published in 2012 by Daniel Field and Nicholas Longrich, researchers from Yale, would later disagree with this assertion upholding that the two should be classified as separate species.</p>
<p><i>Triceratops</i> has been documented by numerous remains collected since the genus was first described in 1889, including at least one complete individual skeleton. Paleontologist John Scannella observed: "It is hard to walk out into the Hell Creek Formation and not stumble upon a <i>Triceratops</i> weathering out of a hillside." Forty-seven complete or partial skulls were discovered in just that area during the decade 2000–2010. Specimens representing life stages from hatchling to adult have been found.</p>
<p>The function of the frills and three distinctive facial horns has long inspired debate. Traditionally these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent theories, noting the presence of blood vessels in the skull bones of ceratopsids, find it more probable that these features were primarily used in identification, courtship and dominance displays, much like the antlers and horns of modern reindeer, mountain goats, or rhinoceros beetles. The theory finds additional support if <i>Torosaurus</i> represents the mature form of <i>Triceratops</i>, as this would mean the frill also developed holes (fenestrae) as individuals reached maturity, rendering the structure more useful for display than defense.</p>

It can appear in the form of code, scripts, active content, and other software. 'Malware' is a general term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software.</p>
<p>Malware includes computer viruses, ransomware, worms, trojan horses, rootkits, keyloggers, dialers, spyware, adware, malicious BHOs, rogue security software, and other malicious programs; the majority of active malware threats are usually worms or trojans rather than viruses. In law, malware is sometimes known as a <b>computer contaminant</b>, as in the legal codes of several U.S. states. Malware is different from defective software, which is a legitimate software but contains harmful bugs that were not corrected before release. However, some malware is disguised as genuine software, and may come from an official company website in the form of a useful or attractive program which has the harmful malware embedded in it along with additional tracking software that gathers marketing statistics.</p>
<p>Software such as anti-virus, anti-malware, and firewalls are relied upon by users at home, small and large organizations around the globe to safeguard against malware attacks which helps in identifying and preventing the further spread of malware in the network.</p>
<p>As of 2012<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup> approximately 60 to 70 percent of all active malware used some kind of click fraud to monetize their activity.</p>
