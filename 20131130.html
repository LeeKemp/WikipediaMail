		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 30 November 2013 </h1><h2> XUnit</h2><p>When developing software, testing the software is a mandatory step. One type of testing, unit testing, involves testing the fundamental units of the software. It may be carried out by writing code that tries out the target unit, checking inputs and outputs, one detail at a time. By keeping such automated testing code, programmers can verify that they haven't broken something along the way. Software to manage these tests are often called code-driven testing frameworks.</p>
<p>Various such frameworks have come to be known collectively as <b>xUnit</b>. These allow testing of different elements (units) of software, such as functions and classes. The main advantage of xUnit frameworks is that they provide an automated solution with no need to write the same tests many times, and no need to remember what should be the result of each test. These frameworks are based on a design by Kent Beck, originally implemented for Smalltalk as SUnit. Erich Gamma and Kent Beck ported SUnit to Java, creating JUnit. From there, the framework was also ported to other programming languages, e.g., CppUnit (for C++), NUnit (for .NET), MATLAB Unit Testing Framework. They are all referred to as <b>xUnit</b> and are usually free, open-source software.</p>

His eponymous first album was released in 1989 and peaked at Number 2 in the US country album chart while climbing to number 13 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Brooks' integration of rock elements into his recordings and live performances earned him immense popularity. This progressive approach allowed him to dominate the country single and album charts while quickly crossing over into the mainstream pop arena, exposing country music to a larger audience.</p>
<p>Brooks has enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the 1990s. His recordings continue to sell well and, according to Nielsen Soundscan, his albums sales through May 2013 are 68,630,000, which makes him the best-selling albums artist in the United States in the SoundScan era (since 1991), a title held since 1991, well over 5 million ahead of his nearest rival, The Beatles. Furthermore, according to RIAA he is the second best-selling solo albums artist in the United States of all time behind Elvis Presley (overall third to the Beatles and Elvis Presley) with 128 million units sold. Brooks has released six albums that achieved diamond status in the United States, those being: <i>Garth Brooks</i> (10× platinum), <i>No Fences</i> (17× platinum), <i>Ropin' the Wind</i> (14× platinum), <i>The Hits</i> (10× platinum), <i>Sevens</i> (10× platinum) and <i>Double Live</i> (21× platinum). Since 1989, Brooks has released 19 records in all, which include; 10 studio albums, 1 live album, 3 compilation albums, 3 Christmas albums and 3 box sets, along with 77 singles. He won several important awards in his career, including 2 Grammy Awards, 17 American Music Awards (including the "Artist of the '90s") and the RIAA Award as Best selling solo albums artist of the Century in the United States.</p>
<p>Troubled by conflicts between career and family, Brooks officially retired from recording and performing from 2001 until 2009. During this time, he sold millions of albums through an exclusive distribution deal with Walmart and sporadically released new singles. In 2005, Brooks started a partial comeback, and has since given several performances and released two compilation albums.</p>
<p>On October 15, 2009, Garth Brooks announced the end of his retirement. In December 2009, he began a five-year concert deal with the Encore Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Brooks was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on October 21, 2012.</p>

In Aptoide, unlike the default Google Play Store, there is not a unique and centralized store but each user manages their own store.</p>
<p>The Android application used to access the stores is open source, and there are several forks such as F-Droid and ApkTor. The communication between the client and servers is done using an open protocol based on XML.</p>
<p>The concept is inspired in APT packaging manager, which can work with multiple sources (repositories). When the user wants a package, they use the client to search for sources where the application is stored.</p>
<p>The name Aptoide is formed from the words: "APT" (the Linux package manager) + "Oide" (the finalization of Android word).</p>
