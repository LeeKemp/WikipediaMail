  title: Climatic Research Unit email controversy
  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>Climatic Research Unit email controversy</b> (also known as <b>"Climategate"</b>) began in November 2009 with the hacking of a server at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) by an external attacker. Several weeks before the Copenhagen Summit on climate change, an unknown individual or group breached CRU's server and copied thousands of emails and computer files to various locations on the Internet.</p>
    <p>The story was first broken by climate change critics on their blogs, with columnist James Delingpole popularising the term "Climategate" to describe the controversy. Climate change critics and others denying the significance of human caused climate change argued that the emails showed that global warming was a scientific conspiracy, in which they alleged that scientists manipulated climate data and attempted to suppress critics. The accusations were rejected by the CRU, who said that the emails had been taken out of context and merely reflected an honest exchange of ideas.</p>
    <p>The mainstream media picked up the story as negotiations over climate change mitigation began in Copenhagen on 7 December. Because of the timing, scientists, policy makers, and public relations experts said that the release of emails was a smear campaign intended to undermine the climate conference. In response to the controversy, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released statements supporting the scientific consensus that the Earth's mean surface temperature had been rising for decades, with the AAAS concluding "based on multiple lines of scientific evidence that global climate change caused by human activities is now underway...it is a growing threat to society."</p>
    <p>Eight committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. However, the reports called on the scientists to avoid any such allegations in the future by taking steps to regain public confidence in their work, for example by opening up access to their supporting data, processing methods and software, and by promptly honouring freedom of information requests. The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged throughout the investigations.</p>

  title: Brian Griffin
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Brian Griffin</b> is a fictional character from the animated television series <i>Family Guy</i>. An anthropomorphic dog, voiced by Seth MacFarlane, he was one of the show's main characters and a member of the Griffin family.</p>
    <p>He first appeared on television, along with the rest of the family, in a 15-minute short on December 20, 1998. Brian was created and designed by MacFarlane himself. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company based on <i>The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve</i>, two shorts made by MacFarlane (the second one at Hanna-Barbera for Cartoon Network's "What-A-Cartoon" project) which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the green light, the Griffin family appeared on the episode "Death Has a Shadow".</p>
    <p>Brian was a member of the Griffin family. He primarily worked in the series as a struggling writer attempting essays, books, novels, screenplays and newspaper articles. His appearance was a redesign of the protagonist Steve from MacFarlane's previous animated short films, <i>The Life of Larry &amp; Steve</i>. He has been featured in much of the <i>Family Guy</i> merchandise, including toys, t-shirts, and video games, and has made crossover appearances in the other MacFarlane-produced shows, <i>American Dad!</i> and <i>The Cleveland Show</i>.</p>
    <p>In the twelfth season episode "Life of Brian", Brian dies after being struck by a car.</p>

    <p><b>Java</b> (Indonesian: <i><b>Jawa</b></i>) is an island of Indonesia. With a population of 135 million (excluding the 3.6 million on the island of Madura which is administered as part of the provinces of Java), Java is the world's most populous island, and one of the most densely populated places in the world. Java is the home of 60 percent of the Indonesian population. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 40s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.</p>
    <p>Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions, Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in Indonesia. A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east-west spine along the island. It has three main languages, though Javanese is dominant, and it is the native language of about 60 million people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java. Most of its residents are bilingual, with Indonesian as their first or second languages. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java has a diverse mixture of religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.</p>
    <p>Java is divided into four provinces, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Banten, and also two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.</p>

  title: Noida double murder case
  extract: |
    <p>The <b>Noida double murder case</b> refers to the murder of 14-year old Aarushi Talwar and 45-year old Hemraj Banjade, a domestic help employed by her family, in Noida, India. The two were killed on the night of 15â€“16 May 2008 at Aarushi's home. The case aroused public interest as a whodunit story. It received heavy media coverage in India, and was also covered by the foreign media. The sensational nature of the media coverage, which included salacious allegations against Aarushi and the suspects, was criticized by many as a trial by media.</p>
    <p>When Aarushi's body was discovered on 16 May, the missing live-in servant Hemraj was considered as the main suspect. However, the next day, his dead body was discovered on the terrace. The police were heavily criticized for botching the investigation by failing to secure the crime scene and not following important leads immediately.</p>
    <p>Initially, the Talwars' former servant Vishnu Sharma was considered as a suspect, as he had lost his job to Hemraj. However, soon, Aarushi's parents (Dr. Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar) became the main suspects. The police believed that Aarushi's father Rajesh had murdered the two after learning about a sexual relationship between them, or that Rajesh had hit Aarushi fatally after she confronted him about his alleged extra-marital affair (while Hemraj was killed as he was a witness to Aarushi's death). An alternative theory stated that Hemraj was the main target of the killing as he was blackmailing Rajesh, while Aarushi was killed for being a witness. The accusations enraged the friends and family members of the Talwars, who alleged that the police was trying to frame the parents in a bid to cover up its own incompetence and botched-up investigation. On 31 May, the case was transferred from the Uttar Pradesh Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Rajesh was released in June 2008, after the investigators could not find any solid evidence against him.</p>
    <p>By this time, the CBI's suspicion had moved to Hemraj's Nepali acquaintances: Krishna (an assistant at the Talwars' clinic), Rajkumar and Vijay (domestic servants). According to the CBI, the three men were let in the house by Hemraj. Krishna, who worked as an assistant at the Talwars' clinic, held a grudge against Rajesh, who had reprimanded him for an occupational mistake. The investigators suspected that the three men tried to sexually assault Aarushi and killed her when she resisted; Hemraj was killed as he was the only witness to their entry in the house. The CBI claimed that the three men had confessed to the crime in narco tests after being injected with sodium pentothal. However, there were accusations that the three men had been drilled with misinformation prior to their tests, and their lawyer later approached the NHRC with video recordings of the tests that allegedly showed the CBI "putting words in their mouths" and torturing them to confess the crimes. Their supporters claimed that the investigators were trying to frame the poor Nepalis in order to protect the upper-class Talwars. Ultimately, all the suspects were released due to the lack of any hard evidence: all of them had alibis and their DNA or fingerprints were not found at the crime scene.</p>
    <p>Unable to achieve any further breakthrough, in 2009, CBI handed over the investigation to a new team. After a second investigation, this new team argued that the case should be closed, citing "critical and substantial gaps" in the circumstantial evidence collected and an "absence of a clear-cut motive and incomplete understanding of the sequence of events." It named Rajesh Talwar as the only possible suspect, but stated that there was not enough evidence to charge him. The parents opposed the closure, criticizing the report's conclusion as baseless. The court noted that there was enough evidence to charge the parents, and ordered proceedings against them. The Talwars pleaded not-guilty, as they had done before. On 25 November 2013, a CBI court held the convicted the couple for the murders. The Talwars called the verdict as a miscarriage of justice, and plan to appeal to a higher court.</p>

  title: Flexible glass
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Flexible glass</b> is a legendary lost invention from the time of the reign of the Roman Emperor Tiberius Caesar (between 14â€“37 AD). As recounted by Isidore of Seville, the craftsman who invented the technique brought a drinking bowl made of flexible glass before Caesar who threw it to the floor, whereupon the material dented, rather than shattering. The inventor then repaired the bowl easily with a small hammer. After the inventor swore to the Emperor that he alone knew the technique of manufacture, Tiberius had the man beheaded, fearing such material could undermine the value of gold and silver.</p>
    <p>The story of the sad fate of the inventor of unbreakable glass (vitrum flexile) at the hands of Tiberius (42 BCâ€“37 AD) was first related by two more-or-less contemporary compilers, namely Petronius (c. 27â€“66 AD, Satyricon 51) and Pliny the Elder (23â€“79 AD, Naturalis Historia XXXVI.lxvi.195). Pliny apparently did not believe in vitrum flexile, remarking that the story is more frequently told than it is reliable. Cassius Dio (c. AD 150â€“235, Historia Romana 57.21.7) also told a similar story, writing that â€˜an architect whose name no one knowsâ€™ whom Tiberius had exiled out of jealousy for his skill, â€˜approached him to crave pardon, and while doing so purposely let fall a crystal goblet; and though it was bruised in some way or shattered, yet by passing his hands over it he promptly exhibited it whole once more. For this he hoped to obtain pardon, but instead the emperor put him to death.â€™ The story was picked up and retold by Isidore of Seville (c. 560â€“636, Etymologiae XVI.16.6, â€˜De vitroâ€™). Subsequently the thirteenth century collection of technical recipes by the pseudo-Heraclius included this story, in the section treating glass recipes, using Isidoreâ€™s own words (De coloribus et artibus Romanorum III.vi [256]). This is thus an example of â€˜technical knowledgeâ€™ wending its way from historical gossip (Petronius), to a technical encyclopaedia (Pliny, with reservations), and then via a philological text (Isidore) to a collection of practical craft recipes (pseudo-Heraclius).</p>

  title: Family Guy
  extract: |-
    <p><i><b>Family Guy</b></i> is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.</p>
    <p>The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, <i>The Life of Larry</i> and <i>Larry &amp; Steve</i>. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox on May 15, 1998. The show was given the green light and started production. Shortly after the third season of <i>Family Guy</i> aired in 2001, Fox cancelled the series, putting the series to a 2-year hiatus. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a 4th season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.</p>
    <p><i>Family Guy</i> has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since <i>The Flintstones</i> in 1961. <i>Family Guy</i> has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons for its similarities to <i>The Simpsons</i>.</p>
    <p>Many tie-in media have been released, including <i>Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story</i>, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; <i>Family Guy: Live in Vegas</i>, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the <i>Family Guy</i> universe; and <i>Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy</i> (2010), a series of parodies of the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation. A spin-off series, <i>The Cleveland Show</i>, featuring Cleveland Brown, aired from September 27, 2009 to May 19, 2013. "The Simpsons Guy", a crossover episode with <i>The Simpsons</i>, is scheduled to air in Fall 2014. <i>Family Guy</i> is a joint production by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television. </p>

  title: Doctor Who
  extract: |-
    <p><i><b>Doctor Who</b></i> is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC. The programme depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lordâ€”a time-travelling humanoid alien. He explores the universe in his TARDIS (<b>T</b>ime <b>A</b>nd <b>R</b>elative <b>D</b>imension <b>I</b>n <b>S</b>pace), a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.</p>
    <p>The show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005â€“2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies's tenure as executive producer. In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor. In 2013, the Peabody Awards honoured <i>Doctor Who</i> with an Institutional Peabody "for evolving with technology and the times like nothing else in the known television universe." The programme is listed in <i>Guinness World Records</i> as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world, the "most successful" science fiction series of all timeâ€”based on its over-all broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales, and iTunes trafficâ€” and largest ever simulcast of a TV drama with "The Day of the Doctor". During its original run, it was recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget special effects, and pioneering use of electronic music (originally produced by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop).</p>
    <p>The show is a significant part of British popular culture, and elsewhere it has become a cult television favourite. The show has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. After an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot in the form of a television film, the programme was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T. Davies who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff. Series 1 in the 21st century, featuring Christopher Eccleston as the ninth incarnation, was produced by the BBC. Series 2 and 3 had some development money contributed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), which was credited as a co-producer. <i>Doctor Who</i> also spawned spin-offs in multiple media, including <i>Torchwood</i> (2006â€“11) and <i>The Sarah Jane Adventures</i> (2007â€“11), both created by Russell T Davies; <i>K-9</i> (2009â€“10), the Auton trilogy and a single pilot episode of <i>K-9 and Company</i> (1981). There also have been many spoofs and cultural references of the character in other media.</p>
    <p>Eleven actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show as regeneration, a life process of Time Lords through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality, which occurs after sustaining injury which would be fatal to most other species. Although each portrayal of the Doctor is different, and on occasions the various incarnations have even met one another, they are all meant to be aspects of the same character. The Doctor as of 2013 is portrayed by Matt Smith, who took up the role after David Tennant's last appearance. On 1 June 2013, it was announced that Matt Smith would leave the series and the eleventh Doctor would regenerate in the 2013 Christmas special. On 4 August 2013, Peter Capaldi was announced as the twelfth incarnation of the Doctor.</p>

    <p><i>Family Guy</i> is an American animated television sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the dysfunctional Griffin family, which consists of father Peter (MacFarlane), mother Lois (Alex Borstein), daughter Meg (Mila Kunis; Lacey Chabert, 1999; Rachael MacFarlane, pilot), son Chris (Seth Green), baby Stewie (MacFarlane) and Brian (MacFarlane), the family dog. The show is set in the fictional town of Quahog, Rhode Island, and lampoons American culture, often in the form of cutaway gags, and tangential vignettes.</p>
    <p>The concept of <i>Family Guy</i> was conceived by MacFarlane in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design. He created two shorts entitled <i>The Life of Larry</i> and <i>Larry &amp; Steve</i>, both of which played a key role in Fox executives' decision to pick up the series in 1998. After two seasons, Fox decided to cancel the show. Despite the cancellation, a third season was produced, after which the series was officially canceled at the end of 2003. Reruns on Cartoon Network's block Adult Swim drove up interest, and a letter-writing campaign, along with impressive DVD sales, encouraged Fox to bring the show back permanently. <i>Family Guy</i> returned to production in 2005, and is contracted to continue producing episodes until at least 2013. In May 2013, <i>Family Guy</i> was renewed for an 12th season in 2013/14.</p>
    <p><i>Family Guy</i> and its cast have been nominated for thirteen Emmy Awards, with four wins. MacFarlane won the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance award for his performance as Stewie, Murphy and MacFarlane won the Outstanding Music and Lyrics award for the song "You Got a Lot to See" from the episode "Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows", Steven Fonti won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode "No Chris Left Behind", and Greg Colton won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode "Road to the Multiverse". The show was nominated for eleven Annies, and won three times, twice in 2006 and once in 2008. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in this category since <i>The Flintstones</i> in 1961.</p>

    <p><b>Thanksgiving</b>, or <b>Thanksgiving Day</b>, is a holiday celebrated in the United States on the fourth Thursday in November. It became an official Federal holiday in 1863, when, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of "Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens", to be celebrated on Thursday, November 26. As a federal and public holiday in the U.S., Thanksgiving is one of the major holidays of the year. Together with Christmas and New Year, Thanksgiving is a part of the broader holiday season.</p>
    <p>The event that Americans commonly call the "First Thanksgiving" was celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World in 1621. This feast lasted three days, and it was attended by 90 Native Americans (as accounted by attendee Edward Winslow) and 53 Pilgrims. The New England colonists were accustomed to regularly celebrating "thanksgivings"â€”days of prayer thanking God for blessings such as military victory or the end of a drought.</p>
