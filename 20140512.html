		<h1>Popular Pages - Monday 12 May 2014 </h1><h2> Dorothy Hodgkin</h2><p><b>Dorothy Mary Hodgkin</b>, OM, FRS (12 May 1910 – 29 July 1994), <i>née</i> Crowfoot, was a British biochemist, credited with the development of protein crystallography. She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964.</p>
<p>She advanced the technique of X-ray crystallography, a method used to determine the three-dimensional structures of biomolecules. Among her most influential discoveries are the confirmation of the structure of penicillin that Ernst Boris Chain and Edward Abraham had previously surmised, and then the structure of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, for which she became the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
<p>In 1969, after 35 years of work and five years after winning the Nobel Prize, Hodgkin was able to decipher the structure of insulin. X-ray crystallography became a widely used tool and was critical in later determining the structures of many biological molecules where knowledge of structure is critical to an understanding of function. She is regarded as one of the pioneer scientists in the field of X-ray crystallography studies of biomolecules. Hodgkin published as Dorothy Crowfoot until 1949, when she was persuaded by Hans Clarke’s secretary to use her married name on her chapter in <i>The Chemistry of Penicillin</i>. Thereafter she always published as Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin.</p>

It was to start from the existing Eglinton West Station on the Toronto Transit Commission's Yonge-University-Spadina line and terminate at Black Creek Drive in its initial phase. City of York Mayor Fergy Brown, Metro Toronto Chairman Alan Tonks, Ontario Premier Bob Rae, Ontario Minister of Transportation Gilles Pouliot, and TTC Chair Mike Colle broke ground on the project in a ceremony on 25 August 1994 at Eglinton Avenue and Black Creek Drive; however, work was halted in 1995 when the newly elected Government of Ontario under Mike Harris cancelled the project. The excavation under Eglinton West intended to be Allen Station was subsequently filled in.</p>

It has an average adult weight of 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). The species is native to tropical and temperate waters around the globe. It resembles a fish head with a tail, and its main body is flattened laterally. Sunfish can be as tall as they are long when their dorsal and ventral fins are extended.</p>
<p>Sunfish live on a diet that consists mainly of jellyfish, but because this diet is nutritionally poor, they consume large amounts in order to develop and maintain their great bulk. Females of the species can produce more eggs than any other known vertebrate. Sunfish fry resemble miniature pufferfish, with large pectoral fins, a tail fin and body spines uncharacteristic of adult sunfish.</p>
<p>Adult sunfish are vulnerable to few natural predators, but sea lions, orcas and sharks will consume them. Among humans, sunfish are considered a delicacy in some parts of the world, including Japan, the Korean peninsula and Taiwan. In the EU, regulations ban the sale of fish and fishery products derived of the Molidae family. Sunfish are frequently, though accidentally, caught in gillnets.</p>
<p>A member of the order Tetraodontiformes, which also includes pufferfish, porcupinefish and filefish, the sunfish shares many traits common to members of this order. It was originally classified as <i>Tetraodon mola</i> under the pufferfish genus, but it has since been given its own genus, <i>Mola</i>, with two species under it. The ocean sunfish, <i>Mola mola</i>, is the type species of the genus.</p>

The film retells the origin of Godzilla in contemporary times as a "terrifying force of nature" in a style faithful to the Toho series of <i>Godzilla</i> films. The film is directed by British filmmaker Gareth Edwards, written by Max Borenstein and stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, and Bryan Cranston.</p>
<p>The film is a co-production between Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Bros. will also distribute the film worldwide, except in Japan where it will be distributed by Toho.
