		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 26 March 2014 </h1><h2> Graham Island (Sicily)</h2><p><b>Ferdinandea</b> (Sicilian: <i><b>Ìsula Firdinandèa</b></i>) is a submerged volcanic island discovered when it last appeared on August 1 1831 by Humphrey Senhouse, the captain of the Royal Navy flag Ship St Vincent and named after Sir James Graham, the First Lord of the Admiralty. It was claimed by the United Kingdom. It forms part of the underwater volcano Empedocles, 30 km (19 mi) south of Sicily, and which is one of a number of submarine volcanoes known as the Campi Flegrei del Mar di Sicilia. Currently a seamount, eruptions have raised it above sea level several times before erosion has caused it to submerge again. When it last rose above sea level after erupting in 1831, a four-way dispute over its sovereignty began, which was still unresolved when it disappeared beneath the waves again in early 1832. During its brief life, the French geologist Constant Prévost was on hand, accompanied by an artist, to witness it in July 1831; he named it <i>Île Julia</i>, for its July appearance, and reported in the <i>Bulletin de la Société Géologique de France</i>. Some observers at the time wondered if a chain of mountains would spring up, linking Sicily to Tunisia and thus upsetting the geopolitics of the region. More recently, it has showed signs of volcanic activity in 2000 and 2002, forecasting a possible appearance; however, as of 2006<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup> it remains 6 m (20 ft) under sea level.</p>

The tinikling is a pre-Spanish dance from the Philippines that involves two people beating, tapping, and sliding bamboo poles on the ground and against each other in coordination with one or more dancers who step over and in between the poles in a dance. The name is a reference to birds locally known as <i>tikling</i>, which can be any of a number of rail species; the term <i>tinikling</i> literally means "tikling-like." The dance originated in Leyte among the Visayan islands in the central Philippines as an imitation of the tikling bird dodging bamboo traps set by rice farmers. The dance imitates the movement of the tikling birds as they walk between grass stems, run over tree branches, or dodge bamboo traps set by rice farmers. Dancers imitate the tikling bird's legendary grace and speed by skillfully maneuvering between large bamboo poles.</p>
<p>Legend says that Tinikling originated during the time when the Spaniards took over the Philippines. Natives worked on large plantations under the control of the King of Spain. Those who didn't work productively were punished by standing between two bamboo poles.</p>
<p>For this traditional folk dance, females wear a dress called <b>balintawak</b> or <b>patadyong</b>, and males wear a uniform called <b>barong tagalog</b>. The balintawak are colorful dresses with wide arched sleeves and the patadyong is a pineapple fiber blouse paired with checkered skirts. The barong tagalog uniform is usually lightweight long sleeved shirts and worn with red trousers. Dancers wear no footwear while performing.</p>
<p>Tinikling involves five steps; during the first four steps, the dancers dance opposite each other, and during the last step, they start from the same side of the poles.</p>
<p>The bamboo is also used as a percussive instrument as it is banged against the ground (or a piece of wood to make it easier to hold) and each other in a pattern. The bamboo has to be closed hard enough to make a sound, and the dancers must be quick enough to not get their foot (or feet) caught. As the dance continues, the banging of the bamboo becomes faster and harder, the sound of the clashing bamboo and the quickness of feet demonstrated by the dancers thrilling and awing the crowd. In the United States, this dance had been altered into a four-beat rhythm to adjust to popular music. In some cases, it has been used in conjunction with traditional Filipino martial arts to demonstrate fleetness of foot and flow of movement.</p>
<p>Today Tinikling is taught throughout the United States. In grades K-12 they use this type of folk dance as an aerobic exercise for physical education classes to help expand physical movements such as hand coordination, foot speed, and also their rhythm. Tinikling is commonly performed on special occasions such as the Filipino Independence Day Independence Day (Philippines). This traditional dance is a celebration of Filipino culture and Filipino pride. </p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinikling' >More...</a><hr><h2> Christian atheism</h2><p><b>Christian atheism</b> is a theological position in which the belief in the God of Christianity is rejected or absent but the moral teachings of Jesus are followed.</p>
<p>Christian atheism is related to Jesusism, the Christian theological-philosophical movement named for its understanding of Jesus as a simple teacher of morals, in direct contrast to traditional Christianity, which claims that Jesus is divine.</p>

Three officers had entered her home in what was later described as a 'botched' drug raid. Officers cut off burglar bars and broke down her door using a no-knock warrant. Police said Johnston fired at them and they fired in response; she fired one shot out the door over the officers' heads and they fired 39 shots, five or six of which hit her. None of the officers were injured by her gunfire, but Johnston was killed by the officers. Police injuries were later attributed to "friendly fire" from each other's weapons.</p>
<p>One of the officers planted marijuana in Johnston's house after the shooting. Later investigations found that the paperwork stating that drugs present at Johnston's house, which had been the basis for the raid, had been falsified. The officers later admitted to having lied when they submitted cocaine as evidence claiming that they had bought it at Johnston's house. Three officers were tried for manslaughter and other charges surrounding falsification and were sentenced to ten, six, and five years.</p>

Sensorineural hearing loss can be mild, moderate, or severe, including total deafness.</p>
<p>The great majority of human sensorineural hearing loss is caused by abnormalities in the hair cells of the organ of Corti in the cochlea. There are also very unusual sensorineural hearing impairments that involve the eighth cranial nerve (the vestibulocochlear nerve) or the auditory portions of the brain. In the rarest of these sorts of hearing loss, only the auditory centers of the brain are affected. In this situation, cortical deafness, sounds may be heard at normal thresholds, but the quality of the sound perceived is so poor that speech cannot be understood.</p>
<p>Most sensory hearing loss is due to poor hair cell function. The hair cells may be abnormal at birth, or damaged during the lifetime of an individual. There are both external causes of damage, like noise trauma and infection, and intrinsic abnormalities, like deafness genes.</p>
<p>Sensory hearing loss that results from abnormalities of the central auditory system in the brain is called central hearing impairment. Since the auditory pathways cross back and forth on both sides of the brain, deafness from a central cause is unusual.</p>
<p>This type of hearing loss can also be caused by prolonged exposure to very loud noise, for example, being in a loud workplace without hearing protection, or having headphones set to high volumes for a long period.</p>

The show was renewed for the final season on December 21, 2012, after cast member Jason Segel changed his decision to leave the show after Season 8. Cristin Milioti, who was revealed as "The Mother" in the Season 8 finale, was promoted to a series regular, the first time <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> added a new regular cast member. Season 9 will consist of 24 episodes, each running approximately 22 minutes in length.</p>
<p>Taking place immediately after where the previous season left off, Season 9 will cover the events of a single weekend that lead up to Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) and Robin's (Cobie Smulders) wedding. During the course of the weekend, "The Mother" (Milioti) will separately be introduced to Robin, Barney, Lily (Alyson Hannigan), and Marshall (Segel), before finally meeting Ted (Josh Radnor). The season will also feature frequent flashbacks and flashforwards in order to fully integrate The Mother's character with the rest of the cast. Thomas said in an interview that Season 9 is like "the Wild West – anything can happen".</p>
<p>In February 2013, Bays and Thomas teased that Season 9 is "going to be a new way to tell the story". The initial reaction to the new storytelling structure of Season 9 was mixed. Ethan Anderton from <i>Screen Rant</i> was concerned about how "24 episodes of television are going to be crafted from just three days of time", and Alan Sepinwall of <i>HitFix</i> was exasperated that after eight seasons, "They are really going to stretch Robin and Barney's wedding weekend out over the entire final season," though he expressed more optimism after the San Diego Comic-Con panel for the final season. Gareth Mitchell at "House of Geekery" also responded negatively, stating that they are "struggling to come up with stories that last out the 22 minutes".</p>

The novel developed from the short story "Dandelion Wine" which appeared in the June 1953 issue of <i>Gourmet</i> magazine.</p>
<p>The title refers to a wine made with dandelion petals and other ingredients, commonly citrus fruit. In the story, dandelion wine, as made by the protagonist's grandfather, serves as a metaphor for packing all of the joys of summer into a single bottle.</p>
<p>The main character of the story is Douglas Spaulding, a 12-year-old boy loosely patterned after Bradbury. Most of the book is focused upon the routines of small-town America, and the simple joys of yesterday.</p>
