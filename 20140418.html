		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 18 April 2014 </h1><h2> Good Friday</h2><p><b>Good Friday</b> is a religious holiday observed primarily by Christians commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary. The holiday is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover. It is also known as <b>Holy Friday</b>, <b>Great Friday</b>, <b>Black Friday</b>, or <b>Easter Friday</b>, though the latter properly refers to the Friday in Easter week.</p>
<p>Based on the details of the Canonical gospels, the Crucifixion of Jesus was most likely to have been on a Friday (the day before the Sabbath) (John 19:42). The estimated year of the Crucifixion is AD 33, by two different groups, and originally as AD 34 by Isaac Newton via the differences between the Biblical and Julian calendars and the crescent of the moon. A third method, using a completely different astronomical approach based on a lunar Crucifixion darkness and eclipse model (consistent with Apostle Peter's reference to a "moon of blood" in Acts 2:20), points to Friday, 3 April AD 33.</p>
<p>Good Friday is a widely-instituted legal holiday in many national governments around the world, including in most Western countries as well as in 12 U.S. states. Some governments have laws prohibiting certain acts that are seen as contrasting the solemn nature of the day.</p>

Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in his leaving law school for a career in journalism. From early on, he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha; they had two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo.</p>
<p>García Márquez started as a journalist, and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> (1967), <i>Autumn of the Patriarch</i> (1975) and <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i> (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo (the town mainly inspired by his birthplace Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme of solitude.</p>

The ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association), in response to criticism of violent content found in video games such as <i>Night Trap</i>, <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, and other controversial video games portraying excessively violent or intense sexual situations.</p>
<p>The board assigns ratings to games based on their content, using judgment similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries, using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability, along with a system of "content descriptors" which detail specific types of content present in a particular game. The ESRB also maintains an code of ethics for the advertising and promotion of video games, ensuring that marketing materials for games display their ESRB ratings information, and are targeted to appropriate audiences. The ESRB also operates an online privacy certification program, and in 2011, began a program for rating mobile apps in partnership with CTIA.</p>
<p>Although use of the ESRB ratings system is not enforced by federal law in either the United States and Canada, it is effectively a de facto standard because of how it is treated by the industry: major console manufacturers will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings, most retail stores enforce ESRB ratings, and also do not carry any games which are not rated by the organization. Due to the level of consumer and retail awareness of the ratings system, along with the organization's efforts to ensure that retailers comply with the ratings system and that publishers comply with its marketing code, the ESRB has considered its system to be effective, and was praised by Federal Trade Commission for being the "strongest" self-regulatory organization in the entertainment sector. Despite this, the ESRB has still faced criticism for not rating certain games harshly enough for their violent content, and was also criticized for its handling of objectionable content that could only be accessed through modding.</p>

It is uncommon in much of its range, and listed as <i>Vulnerable</i> by IUCN because of a declining population trend that is estimated at more than 30% over the last three decades.</p>
<p>Thomas Stamford Raffles first described a specimen from Malacca where it is called <i>binturung</i>. In standard Malay, it is known as <i>benturung</i>, and in Riau, Indonesia as <i>tenturun</i>.</p>
<p>The binturong is a monotypic genus. Its genus name <i>Arctictis</i> means ‘bear-weasel’, from Greek <i>arkt-</i> ‘bear’ + <i>iktis</i> ‘weasel’.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binturong' >More...</a><hr><h2> Rabbit</h2><p><b>Rabbits</b> are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, found in several parts of the world. There are eight different genera in the family classified as rabbits, including the European rabbit (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>), cottontail rabbits (genus <i>Sylvilagus</i>; 13 species), and the Amami rabbit (<i>Pentalagus furnessi</i>, an endangered species on Amami Ōshima, Japan). There are many other species of rabbit, and these, along with pikas and hares, make up the order Lagomorpha. The male is called a <i>buck</i> and the female is a <i>doe</i>; a young rabbit is a <i>kitten</i> or <i>kit</i>.</p>

<p>The widely acclaimed book, considered by many to be the author's masterpiece, was first published in Spanish in 1967, and subsequently has been translated into thirty-seven languages and has sold more than 30 million copies. The magic realist style and thematic substance of <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> established it as an important, representative novel of the literary Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, that was stylistically influenced by Modernism (European and North American), and the Cuban <i>Vanguardia</i> (Vanguard) literary movement.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude' >More...</a><hr><h2> Great white shark</h2><p>The <b>great white shark</b> (<i>Carcharodon carcharias</i>), also known as the <b>great white</b>, <b>white pointer</b>, <b>white shark</b>, or <b>white death</b>, is a species of large lamniform shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. The great white shark is mainly known for its size, with mature individuals growing up to 6.4 m (21 ft) in length (although reports have been published of great white sharks measuring over 8 m (26 ft), and 3,324 kg (7,328 lb) in weight). This shark reaches its maturity around 15 years of age and was previously believed to have a life span of over 30 years. The true lifespan of great white sharks is far longer; now estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently known. Great white sharks can accelerate to speeds that exceed 56 km/h (35 mph).</p>
<p>The great white shark is an apex predator of the seas and has no natural predators other than the Orca. The great white shark is arguably the world's largest known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, including fish and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus <i>Carcharodon</i>, and is ranked first in having the most attacks on humans. The IUCN list the great white shark as a vulnerable species, while it is included in Appendix II of CITES.</p>
<p>The bestselling novel <i>Jaws</i> by Peter Benchley and the subsequent blockbuster film by Steven Spielberg depicted the great white shark as a "ferocious man eater". In reality, humans are not the preferred prey of the great white shark, however of all shark species, the great white shark is responsible for by far the largest number of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans.</p>
