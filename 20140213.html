		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 13 February 2014 </h1><h2> Sarojini Naidu</h2><p><b>Sarojini Naidu</b>, born as <b>Sarojini Chattopadhyay</b> (Bengali: সরোজিনী চট্টোপাধ্যায়) also known by the sobriquet as <b>The Nightingale of India</b>, was a child prodigy, Indian independence activist and poet. Naidu served as the first governor of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh from 1947 to 1949; the first woman to become the governor of an Indian state. She was the second woman to become the president of the Indian National Congress in 1925 and the first Indian woman to do so.</p>

He also acted in films, including the 1963 screwball comedy, <i>It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</i>.</p>
<p>Caesar was considered a "sketch comic" and actor, as opposed to a stand-up comedian. He also relied more on body language, accents, and facial contortions, than simply dialogue. Unlike the slapstick comedy which was standard on TV, his style was considered "avant garde" in the 1950s. He conjured up ideas and scenes, and used writers to flesh out the concept and create the dialogue. Among the writers who wrote for Caesar early in their careers, were Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Larry Gelbart, Carl Reiner, Michael Stewart, Mel Tolkin and Woody Allen. "Sid's was the show to which all comedy writers aspired. It was the place to be", said Steve Allen.</p>
<p>Among his TV shows' subjects were satires about real life events and people, and parodies of popular film genres, theater, television shows and opera. But unlike other comedy shows at the time, the dialogue was considered sharper, funnier and more adult oriented. He was "best known as one of the most intelligent and provocative innovators of television comedy", who some critics called "television's Charlie Chaplin", and the <i>New York Times</i> refers to as the "comedian of comedians from TV's early days".</p>
<p>Honored in numerous ways over sixty years, he was nominated for Emmy Awards eleven times, winning twice. He was also a saxophonist and author of several books, including two autobiographies in which he described his career and later struggle to overcome years of alcoholism and barbiturates.</p>
