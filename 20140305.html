		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 05 March 2014 </h1><h2> Richard Lee McNair</h2><p><b>Richard Lee McNair</b> (born December 19, 1958) is a convicted murderer known for his ability to escape and elude capture. In 1987, McNair murdered one man and shot a second man four times during a botched robbery. He is currently serving two terms of life imprisonment for these crimes.</p>
<p>After McNair's arrest, he escaped three times from three different institutions using various creative methods. On his first attempt he used lip balm to squeeze out of a pair of handcuffs. He escaped a second time by crawling through a ventilation duct. In his last escape from a federal prison in April 2006, he mailed himself out of prison in a crate. This resulted in his being featured a dozen times on the TV show <i>America's Most Wanted</i>, and made him one of the top fifteen fugitives wanted by US Marshals. McNair traveled to Canada twice in order to evade capture, traveling across the country for over a year before being apprehended in a random police check. Much of what the public knows about McNair's escape and his time as a fugitive is through McNair's prison correspondence with a Canadian journalist, Byron Christopher.</p>

Occurring 46 days before Easter, it is a moveable feast that can fall as early as February 4 and as late as March 10.</p>
<p>According to the canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus Christ spent 40 days fasting in the desert, where he endured temptation by Satan. Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of this 40-day liturgical period of prayer and fasting or abstinence. Of the 46 days until Easter, six are Sundays. As the Christian designation of Sabbath, Sundays are not included in the fasting period and are instead "feast" days during Lent.</p>
<p>Ash Wednesday derives its name from the practice of placing ashes (formally called <i>The Imposition of Ashes</i>)on the foreheads of adherents as a celebration and reminder of human mortality, and as a sign of mourning and repentance to God. The ashes used are typically gathered from the burning of the palms from the previous year's Palm Sunday.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday' >More...</a><hr><h2> Mardi Gras</h2><p><b>Mardi Gras</b> /ˈmɑrdiɡrɑː/, also <b>Fat Tuesday</b>  in English, refers to events of the Carnival celebrations, beginning on or after the Epiphany or Kings day and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday. <i>Mardi Gras</i> is French for "Fat Tuesday," reflecting the practice of the last night of eating richer, fatty foods before the ritual fasting of the Lenten season.</p>
<p>Related popular practices are associated with celebrations before the fasting and religious obligations associated with the penitential season of Lent. The date of Fat Tuesday coincides with that of celebrations of Shrove Tuesday, from the word <i>shrive</i>, meaning "confess."</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardi_Gras' >More...</a><hr><h2> Shrove Tuesday</h2><p><b>Shrove Tuesday</b> (widely known as <b>Pancake Day</b>) is a day in February or March, preceding Ash Wednesday (the first day of Lent), which is celebrated in many countries by consuming pancakes.</p>
<p>Shrove Tuesday, a moveable feast, is determined by Easter. The expression "Shrove Tuesday" comes from the word <i>shrive</i>, meaning "confess". Shrove Tuesday is observed by many Christians, including Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Roman Catholics, who "make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God's help in dealing with."</p>
<p>Being the last day before the penitential season of Lent, related popular practices, such as indulging in food that one sacrifices for the upcoming forty days, are associated with Shrove Tuesday celebrations, before commencing the fasting and religious obligations associated with Lent. The term <i>Mardi Gras</i> is French for "Fat Tuesday," referring to the practice of the last night of eating richer, fatty foods before the ritual fasting of the Lenten season, which begins on Ash Wednesday.</p>

<p>Attachment theory, initially studied in the 1960s and '70s primarily in the context of children and parents, was extended to adult romantic relationships in the late 1980s. Four main styles of attachment have been identified in adults:</p>
<ul><li>secure</li>
<li>anxious–preoccupied</li>
<li>dismissive–avoidant</li>
<li>fearful–avoidant.</li>
</ul><p>Investigators have explored the organization and the stability of mental <i>working models</i> that underlie these attachment styles. They have also explored how attachment impacts relationship outcomes and how attachment functions in relationship dynamics.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults' >More...</a><hr><h2> Lent</h2><p><b>Lent</b> (Latin: <b>Quadragesima</b> - English: <i>Fortieth</i>) is a solemn religious observance in the liturgical calendar of many Christian denominations that begins on Ash Wednesday and covers a period of approximately six weeks before Easter Day.</p>
<p>The traditional purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer through prayer, penance, repentance of sins, almsgiving, atonement and self-denial. Its institutional purpose is heightened in the annual commemoration of Holy Week, marking the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus, which recalls the tradition and events of the New Testament beginning on Friday of Sorrows, further climaxing on Jesus' crucifixion on Good Friday, which ultimately culminates in the joyful celebration on Easter Sunday of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>

</dl><p><b>Dermatophytosis</b> is a clinical condition caused by fungal infection of the skin in humans, pets such as cats, and domesticated animals such as sheep and cattle. The term "<b>ringworm</b>", commonly used to refer to such infections, is a misnomer, since the condition is caused by fungi of several different species and not by parasitic worms. The fungi that cause parasitic infection (dermatophytes) feed on keratin, the material found in the outer layer of skin, hair, and nails. These fungi thrive on skin that is warm and moist, but may also survive directly on the outsides of hair shafts or in their interiors. In pets, the fungus responsible for the disease survives in skin and on the outer surface of hairs.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that currently up to twenty percent<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> of the population may be infected by ringworm or one of the other dermatophytoses. It is especially common among people who play sports, wrestling in particular. Wrestlers with ringworm may be withheld from competition until their skin condition is deemed non-infectious by the proper authorities.</p>
