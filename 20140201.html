		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 01 February 2014 </h1><h2> Harriet Tubman</h2><p><b>Harriet Tubman</b> (born <b>Araminta Harriet Ross</b>; 1820 – March 10, 1913) was an African-American abolitionist, humanitarian, and Union spy during the American Civil War. Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made more than nineteen missions to rescue more than 300 slaves using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. She later helped John Brown recruit men for his raid on Harpers Ferry, and in the post-war era struggled for women's suffrage.</p>
<p>As a child in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman was beaten by masters to whom she was hired out. Early in her life, she suffered a severe head wound when hit by a heavy metal weight. The injury caused disabling seizures, narcoleptic attacks, headaches, and powerful visionary and dream experiences, which occurred throughout her life. A devout Christian, Tubman ascribed the visions and vivid dreams to revelations from God.</p>
<p>In 1849, Tubman escaped to Philadelphia, then immediately returned to Maryland to rescue her family. Slowly, one group at a time, she brought relatives out of the state, and eventually guided dozens of other slaves to freedom. Traveling by night, Tubman (or "Moses", as she was called) "never lost a passenger". Large rewards were offered for the return of many of the fugitive slaves, but no one then knew that Tubman was the one helping them. When the Southern-dominated Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, requiring law officials in free states to aid efforts to recapture slaves, she helped guide fugitives farther north into Canada, where slavery had been abolished in 1834.</p>
<p>When the American Civil War began, Tubman worked for the Union Army, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy. The first woman to lead an armed expedition in the war, she guided the Combahee River Raid, which liberated more than 700 slaves in South Carolina. After the war, she retired to the family home in Auburn, New York, where she cared for her aging parents. She became active in the women's suffrage movement in New York until illness overtook her. Near the end of her life, she lived in a home for elderly African Americans that she had helped found years earlier.</p>

<p>The network was created in 1997 by retired advertising executive Dan FitzSimons. FitzSimons and his daughter Molly stated in a featured segment on <i>This American Life</i> that he came up with the idea when he was watching the O.J. Simpson murder case during the daytime and kept flipping through the channels during lulls in the trial only to see nothing was on but game shows, soaps, and reruns. FitzSimons said he thought "Something else is necessary. There's a need for a parking place on television. If you don't want to watch something that is there, you could have the TV set on, and it'd be playing something that didn't bother you, and would hold the place until your favorite show or what you chose to watch." To fill this need, he conceived of a channel that would show "24 hours a day, 7 days a week, footage of puppies fooling around like puppies do, acting the natural comedians and cuties that they are, with no people, no talk, accompanied only by relaxing instrumental music."</p>
<p>According to Molly FitzSimons, 41% of people in focus group surveys said they would prefer watching the channel to CNBC and 37% preferred it to TBS.</p>
<p>At its peak in 1998, The Puppy Channel was seen on four local cable systems around the U.S., before FitzSimons decided to give up in 2001.</p>
<p>The one-hour pilot show that was seen on cable TV is now digitized in DVD form to demonstrate to the TV business the programming concept's interactivity and suitability as video on demand (VOD). In 2001 after the dotcom bubble burst, the company's cable programming ended. Much of the original pilot show's video is currently viewable online at thepuppychannel.com, where people also are invited to upload video of their own puppies.</p>

Nazi doctors found that equipment-laden test subjects who had taken the drug could march 88.5 kilometers (55 miles) without resting before they collapsed. Each tablet contained 5 mg of oxycodone (brand name Eukodal), 5 mg of cocaine and 3 mg of methamphetamine (then called Pervitin, now available under the brandname Desoxyn). The researcher who uncovered the project, Wolf Kemper, said: "The aim was to use D-IX to redefine the limits of human endurance." Test subjects could march in a circle for up to 90 kilometers per day without rest while carrying a 20 kilogram backpack. Nazi doctors were enthusiastic about the results, and planned to supply all German troops with the pills, but the war ended before D-IX could be put into mass production, though it did see limited use among a handful of Neger and Biber pilots.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-IX' >More...</a><hr><h2> Kim Källström</h2><p><b>Kim Mikael Källström</b> (<small>Swedish pronunciation: </small>[kɪm ˈɕɛl.ˈstrœm]; born 24 August 1982) is a Swedish footballer who plays as a midfielder for Arsenal on loan from Spartak Moscow. He also plays for the Sweden national team.</p>
<p>Källström has 108 caps for Sweden, and has played in three European Championships and the 2006 FIFA World Cup.</p>

It remains popular in several East Asian countries, such as China, Vietnam, Korea, Taiwan and Japan.</p>

It is scheduled to be held on February 2, 2014, at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, with kickoff scheduled for 6:25pm EST (UTC−05:00).</p>
<p>This will be the first Super Bowl to be played outdoors in a cold weather environment, the first to be played outdoors on artificial turf (in this case FieldTurf) since Super Bowl X at the Miami Orange Bowl, and the first in which two U.S. states (New York and New Jersey) will share hosting duties. It is also the first time since Super Bowl XLIV, and just the second time in the past twenty seasons that the number 1 seeds from each conference will meet to decide the championship. The game will feature the league's top offense (Denver) vs. the top defense (Seattle), and will also feature two former division rivals (Seattle played for the AFC West from 1977 to 2001). Both of these types of match-ups have not occurred since Super Bowl XXXVII.</p>
