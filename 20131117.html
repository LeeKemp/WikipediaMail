		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 17 November 2013 </h1><h2> UFC 167</h2><p><i><b>UFC 167: St-Pierre vs. Hendricks</b></i> was a mixed martial arts event held on November 16, 2013, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S..</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_167' >More...</a><hr><h2> Georges St-Pierre</h2><p><b>Georges St-Pierre</b> (<small>French pronunciation: ​</small>[ʒɔʁʒ sɛ̃ pjɛʁ]; born May 19, 1981), often referred to as <b>GSP</b> and <b>Rush</b>, is a Canadian mixed martial artist and the current Welterweight Champion of the UFC. St-Pierre has for several years been ranked as the #1 welterweight in the world according to Sherdog, and numerous other publications.  In 2008, 2009, and 2010 he was named the Canadian Athlete of the Year by Rogers Sportsnet.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_St-Pierre' >More...</a><hr><h2> The Legend of Korra</h2><p><i><b>The Legend of Korra</b></i> is an American animated television series that premiered on the Nickelodeon television network in 2012. It was created by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino as a sequel to their series <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, which aired on Nickelodeon from 2005 to 2008. Several people involved with creating <i>Avatar</i>, including designer Joaquim Dos Santos and composers Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, returned to work on <i>The Legend of Korra</i>.</p>
<p>The series is set in a fictional universe where some people can manipulate, or "bend", the elements of water, earth, fire, or air. Only one person, the "Avatar", can bend all four elements, and is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. The series follows Avatar Korra, the successor of Aang from the previous series, as she faces political and spiritual unrest in a modernizing world.</p>
<p>The series, whose style is strongly influenced by Japanese animation, has been a critical and commercial success. It obtained the highest audience total for an animated series in the United States in 2012. The series was praised by reviewers for its high production values and for addressing difficult sociopolitical issues such as social unrest and terrorism. It was originally conceived as a miniseries consisting of twelve episodes, but it is now set to run for fifty-two episodes separated into four seasons ("books"), each of which tells a separate story.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra' >More...</a><hr><h2> Johny Hendricks</h2><p><b>Johny Harvey Hendricks</b> (born September 12, 1983) is an American mixed martial artist and an accomplished former collegiate wrestler. He currently fights in the Ultimate Fighting Championship's Welterweight division. As of March 2013, Hendricks is ranked as the #1 Welterweight contender in the world by the UFC's official website. He is known for his very powerful punches, particularly from the left hand, as well as his extensive wrestling background.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johny_Hendricks' >More...</a><hr><h2> Oprah Winfrey</h2><p><b>Oprah Gail Winfrey</b> (born January 29, 1954) is an American media proprietor, talk show host, actress, producer, and philanthropist. Winfrey is best known for her multi-award-winning talk show <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i> which was the highest-rated program of its kind in history and was nationally syndicated from 1986 to 2011. She has been ranked the richest African-American of the 20th century the greatest black philanthropist in American history. She is currently North America's only black billionaire. She is also, according to some assessments, the most influential woman in the world.</p>
<p>Winfrey was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a teenage single mother and later raised in an inner-city Milwaukee neighborhood. She experienced considerable hardship during her childhood, saying she was raped at age nine and became pregnant at 14; her son died in infancy. Sent to live with the man she calls her father, a barber in Tennessee, Winfrey landed a job in radio while still in high school and began co-anchoring the local evening news at the age of 19. Her emotional ad-lib delivery eventually got her transferred to the daytime-talk-show arena, and after boosting a third-rated local Chicago talk show to first place, she launched her own production company and became internationally syndicated.</p>
<p>Credited with creating a more intimate confessional form of media communication, she is thought to have popularized and revolutionized the tabloid talk show genre pioneered by Phil Donahue, which a Yale study says broke 20th-century taboos and allowed LGBT people to enter the mainstream. By the mid-1990s, she had reinvented her show with a focus on literature, self-improvement, and spirituality. Though criticized for unleashing a confession culture, promoting controversial self-help ideas, and an emotion-centered approach she is often praised for overcoming adversity to become a benefactor to others. From 2006 to 2008, her support of Barack Obama, by one estimate, delivered over a million votes in the close 2008 Democratic primary race.</p>

Following a shift in EC's direction in 1950, Gaines presided over what became an artistically influential and historically important line of mature-audience comics. He published the popular satirical magazine <i>Mad</i> for over 40 years.</p>
<p>He was posthumously inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame (1993) and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame (1997). In 2012, he was inducted into the Ghastly Awards' Hall of Fame.</p>

Kennedy, and First Lady of the United States during his presidency from 1961 until his assassination in 1963. Five years later she married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis; they remained married until his death in 1975. For the final two decades of her life, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had a career as a book editor. She is remembered for her contributions to the arts and preservation of historic architecture, her style, elegance, and grace. She was a fashion icon; her famous pink Chanel suit and pillbox hat have become symbols of her husband's assassination and one of the lasting images of the 1960s.</p>

These purposes are related to the linguistic notions of cardinal and ordinal numbers, respectively (see English numerals). A later notion is that of a nominal number, which is used only for naming.</p>
<p>Properties of the natural numbers related to divisibility, such as the distribution of prime numbers, are studied in number theory. Problems concerning counting and ordering, such as partition enumeration, are studied in combinatorics.</p>
<p>There is no universal agreement about whether to include zero in the set of natural numbers: some define the natural numbers to be the <b>positive integers</b> {1, 2, 3, ...}, while for others the term designates the <b>non-negative integers</b> {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. The former definition is the traditional one, with the latter definition having first appeared in the 19th century.</p>

A sequel to <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, the series first aired on Nickelodeon in 2012. Four seasons with a total of 52 episodes have been ordered.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, the series is set in a fictional world inspired by Asian and Inuit cultures, and inhabited by people who can manipulate the elements of water, earth, fire or air through an ability called "bending". One person, the "Avatar", has the ability to bend all four elements. Reincarnating in turn among the world's four nations, he or she is responsible for maintaining peace, harmony, and balance in the world. Korra, the series' protagonist, is the next incarnation of the Avatar after Aang of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>.</p>
<p>Set seventy years after the original series, in a metropolis reminiscent of North American and Asian cities of the 1920s, the series' first season follows Korra as she learns airbending and faces an anti-bender revolutionary group, the "Equalists", led by the masked Amon. The second season sees Korra addressing a conflict between spirits and humans and between the two Water Tribes.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Legend_of_Korra_episodes' >More...</a><hr><h2> Tarrare</h2><p><b>Tarrare</b> (c. 1772 – 1798), sometimes spelled <b>Tarare</b>, was a French showman and soldier, noted for his unusual eating habits. Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. He travelled France in the company of a band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling charlatan; he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and whole apples. He then took this act to Paris where he worked as a street performer.</p>
<p>On the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. With military rations unable to satisfy his large appetite, he would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. Suffering from exhaustion, he was hospitalised and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed an eel whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.</p>
<p>General Alexandre de Beauharnais decided to put Tarrare's abilities to use, and he was employed as a courier by the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. Unfortunately for Tarrare, he could not speak German, and on his first mission was captured by Prussian forces, severely beaten and underwent a mock execution before being returned to French lines.</p>
<p>Chastened by this experience, he agreed to submit to any procedure that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After falling under suspicion of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrare' >More...</a><hr><h2> Over the Top (film)</h2><p><i><b>Over the Top</b></i> is a 1987 action drama film starring Sylvester Stallone. It was produced and directed by Menahem Golan, and its screenplay was written by Stirling Silliphant and Stallone. The original music score was composed by Giorgio Moroder. The main character, played by Stallone, is a long-haul truck driver who tries to win back his alienated son while becoming a champion arm wrestler.</p>
