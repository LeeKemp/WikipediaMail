		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 22 February 2014 </h1><h2> Playboy Bunny</h2><p>A <b>Playboy Bunny</b> is a waitress at the Playboy Club. The Playboy Clubs were originally open from 1960 to 1988. The Club re-opened a location The Palms Hotel in Las Vegas from 2006-2012. Bunnies wore a costume called a "bunny suit" inspired by the tuxedo-wearing Playboy rabbit mascot, consisting of a corset, bunny ears, a collar, cuffs and a fluffy cottontail.</p>

She was known in New Zealand for her roles as host of <i>Getaway</i>, and in Australia as a host on <i>The Contender Australia</i> and as a judge on <i>Australia's Next Top Model</i>.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Dawson' >More...</a><hr><h2> Purple Heart</h2><p>The <b>Purple Heart</b> is a United States military decoration awarded in the name of the President to those wounded or killed, while serving, on or after April 5, 1917, with the U.S. military. With its forerunner, the Badge of Military Merit, which took the form of a heart made of purple cloth, the Purple Heart is the oldest military award still given to U.S. military members; the only earlier award being the obsolete Fidelity Medallion. The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is located in New Windsor, New York.</p>

It was created and executive produced by Humanitas Prize and Emmy Award-winner Chris Nee and premiered on March 23, 2012 on Disney Channel and Disney Junior. The series is about a six-year-old girl who can "fix" toys, with a little help from her stuffed animal friends.</p>
<p>The series received positive reviews due to the show's concept and the main character, on its portrayal about African-Americans in a Disney series. Chris Nee describes the series as "<i>Cheers</i> for Preschoolers".</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_McStuffins' >More...</a><hr><h2> Viktor Ahn</h2><p><b>Viktor Ahn</b> (Russian: Виктор Ан; born November 23, 1985), also known as <b>Ahn Hyun-soo</b> (Korean: 안현수) and <b>Victor An</b>, is a Russian short track speed skating athlete of South Korean descent. After competing for South Korea since childhood, in 2011 he became a Russian citizen and now races for the Russian team. One of the most accomplished short track speed skaters of all time, Ahn won three gold medals and a bronze medal in 2006 Winter Olympics held in Turin, Italy, becoming the most successful athlete there. He has also won three gold medals and one bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, Russia. He is also a five-time Overall World Champion for 2003–2007.</p>
<p>After winning gold in Sochi, Ahn explained his reasons for joining the Russian team saying, "I wanted to train in the best possible environment and I proved my decision was not wrong." As expected, a gold-winning athlete leaving the national team caused public uproar in South Korea. However, it was aimed not at Ahn, but at the country's skating union. Most South Korean fans in a poll said they understood Ahn's decision.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Ahn' >More...</a><hr><h2> Global-warming potential</h2><p><b>Global-warming potential</b> (GWP) is a relative measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere. It compares the amount of heat trapped by a certain mass of the gas in question to the amount of heat trapped by a similar mass of carbon dioxide. A GWP is calculated over a specific time interval, commonly 20, 100 or 500 years. GWP is expressed as a factor of carbon dioxide (whose GWP is standardized to 1). For example, the 20 year GWP of methane is 86, which means that if the same mass of methane and carbon dioxide were introduced into the atmosphere, that methane will trap 86 times more heat than the carbon dioxide over the next 20 years.</p>
<p>The substances subject to restrictions under the Kyoto protocol either are rapidly increasing their concentrations in Earth's atmosphere or have a large GWP.</p>
<p>The GWP depends on the following factors:</p>
<ul><li>the absorption of infrared radiation by a given species</li>
<li>the spectral location of its absorbing wavelengths</li>
<li>the atmospheric lifetime of the species</li>
</ul><p>Thus, a high GWP correlates with a large infrared absorption and a long atmospheric lifetime. The dependence of GWP on the wavelength of absorption is more complicated. Even if a gas absorbs radiation efficiently at a certain wavelength, this may not affect its GWP much if the atmosphere already absorbs most radiation at that wavelength. A gas has the most effect if it absorbs in a "window" of wavelengths where the atmosphere is fairly transparent. The dependence of GWP as a function of wavelength has been found empirically and published as a graph.</p>
<p>Because the GWP of a greenhouse gas depends directly on its infrared spectrum, the use of infrared spectroscopy to study greenhouse gases is centrally important in the effort to understand the impact of human activities on global climate change.</p>
