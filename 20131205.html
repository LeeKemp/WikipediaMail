		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 05 December 2013 </h1><h2> Adam's Bridge</h2><p>Coordinates: 9.1210°N 79.5217°E﻿ / 9.1210; 79.5217</p>

<p><b>Adam's Bridge</b> (Tamil: ஆதாம் பாலம் <i>ātām pālam</i>), also known as <b>Rama's Bridge</b> or <b>Rama Setu</b> (Tamil: இராமர் பாலம் <i>Irāmar pālam</i>, Sanskrit: रामसेतु, <i>rāmasetu</i>), is a chain of limestone shoals, between Pamban Island, also known as Rameswaram Island, off the southeastern coast of Tamil Nadu, India, and Mannar Island, off the northwestern coast of Sri Lanka. Geological evidence suggests that this bridge is a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The bridge is 18 miles (30 km) long and separates the Gulf of Mannar (southwest) from the Palk Strait (northeast). Some of the sandbanks are dry and the sea in the area is very shallow, being only 3 ft to 30 ft (1 m to 10 m) deep in places, which hinders navigation. It was reportedly passable on foot up to the 15th century until storms deepened the channel: temple records seem to say that Rama’s Bridge was completely above sea level until it broke in a cyclone in AD 1480.</p>

She won the Miss Israel title in 2004 and went on to represent Israel at the 2004 Miss Universe beauty pageant. Gadot is known for her role as Gisele Harabo in <i>The Fast and the Furious</i> film series. On December 4, 2013, it was revealed that Gadot had won the role of Wonder Woman in the sequel to <i>Man of Steel</i> starring Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck.</p>

The solution first came from Albert Einstein in a 1926 paper where he used it to explain the erosion of river banks (Baer's law).</p>

This is the central idea of the Prion Hypothesis, which remains debated. This would be in contrast to all other known infectious agents (virus/bacteria/fungus/parasite) which must contain nucleic acids (either DNA, RNA, or both). The word <i>prion</i>, coined in 1982 by Stanley B. Prusiner, is derived from the words <i>protein</i> and <i>infection</i>. Prions are responsible for the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in a variety of mammals, including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as "mad cow disease") in cattle. In humans, prions cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, Fatal Familial Insomnia and kuru. All known prion diseases affect the structure of the brain or other neural tissue and all are currently untreatable and universally fatal. In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD. </p>
<p>Prions, like viruses, are not actually alive, although both can reproduce by hijacking the functions of living cells.</p>
<p>Prions propagate by transmitting a misfolded protein state. If a prion enters a healthy organism, it induces existing, properly folded proteins to convert into the disease-associated, prion form; the prion acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more proteins into prion form. These newly formed prions can then go on to convert more proteins themselves; this triggers a chain reaction that produces large amounts of the prion form. All known prions induce the formation of an amyloid fold, in which the protein polymerises into an aggregate consisting of tightly packed beta sheets. Amyloid aggregates are fibrils, growing at their ends, and replicating when breakage causes two growing ends to become four growing ends. The incubation period of prion diseases is determined by the exponential growth rate associated with prion replication, which is a balance between the linear growth and the breakage of aggregates. (Note that the propagation of the prion depends on the presence of normally folded protein in which the prion can induce misfolding; animals which do not express the normal form of the prion protein cannot develop nor transmit the disease.)</p>
<p>This altered structure is extremely stable and accumulates in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death. This structural stability means that prions are resistant to denaturation by chemical and physical agents, making disposal and containment of these particles difficult. Prions come in different strains, each with a slightly different structure, and most of the time, strains breed true. Prion replication is nevertheless subject to occasional epimutation and then natural selection just like other forms of replication.</p>
<p>All known mammalian prion diseases are caused by the so-called prion protein, PrP. The endogenous, properly folded, form is denoted PrP<sup>C</sup> (for <i><b>C</b>ommon</i> or <i><b>C</b>ellular</i>) while the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (for <i><b>Sc</b>rapie</i>, after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.) The precise structure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrP<sup>C</sup>, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) reaction.</p>
<p>Proteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts.</p>
