		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 02 May 2014 </h1><h2> Ayrton Senna</h2><p><b>Ayrton Senna da Silva</b> (<small>Brazilian Portuguese: </small>[aˈiʁtõ ˈsẽnɐ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ]; 21 March 1960 – 1 May 1994) was a Brazilian racing driver who won three Formula One world championships. He was killed in an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. He was among the most dominant and successful Formula One drivers of the modern era and is considered one of the greatest drivers in the history of the sport. He remains the most recent driver fatality in Formula One.</p>
<p>Senna began his motorsport career in karting, moving up to open-wheel racing in 1981, and winning the British Formula 3 championship in 1983. He made his Formula One debut with Toleman-Hart in 1984 before moving to Lotus-Renault the following year and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons. In 1988, he joined Frenchman Alain Prost at McLaren-Honda. Between them, they won all but one of the 16 Grands Prix that year and Senna claimed his first World Championship. Prost claimed the championship in 1989, and Senna his second and third championships in 1990 and 1991. In 1992, the Williams-Renault combination began to dominate Formula One. Senna nonetheless managed to finish the 1993 season as runner-up, winning five races and negotiating a move to Williams in 1994.</p>
<p>Senna has often been voted as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time in various motorsport polls. He was recognised for his qualifying speed over one lap and from 1989 until 2006 held the record for most pole positions. He was also acclaimed for his wet weather performances, such as the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the 1993 European Grand Prix. He holds a record six victories at the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix, and is the third most successful driver of all time in terms of race wins. Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Alain Prost. In the Japanese Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990, each of which decided the Championship of that year, collisions between Senna and Prost determined the eventual winner.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna' >More...</a><hr><h2> Marie Curie</h2><p><b>Marie Skłodowska-Curie</b> (7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the only woman to win in two fields, and the only person to win in multiple sciences. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon in Paris.</p>
<p>She was born <b>Maria Salomea Skłodowska</b> (<small>pronounced </small>[ˈmarja salɔˈmɛa skwɔˈdɔfska]) in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Floating University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and with physicist Henri Becquerel. She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
<p>Her achievements included a theory of <i>radioactivity</i> (a term that she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms, using radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today. During World War I, she established the first military field radiological centres.</p>
<p>While a French citizen, Marie Skłodowska Curie (she used both surnames) never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland. She named the first chemical element that she discovered – polonium, which she first isolated in 1898 – after her native country.</p>
<p>Curie died in 1934 at the sanatorium of Sancellemoz (Haute-Savoie), France, due to aplastic anemia brought on by exposure to radiation – mainly, it seems, during her World War I service in mobile X-ray units created by her.</p>

She was the second daughter of musician and Live Aid founder Bob Geldof, and the late television presenter Paula Yates (d. 2000). Raised in London, Geldof was educated at Queen's College after her parents' divorce in 1996, and later moved to New York City where she worked as a writer for the UK edition of <i>Elle Girl</i> magazine. She also worked in television, producing and developing her own TV programmes which aired in the United Kingdom in 2006. In the later portion of her life, Geldof worked primarily in modelling and television, and gave birth to sons in 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>Geldof died at her home in April 2014 of unknown causes; the following month, it was reported at her inquest that the use of heroin was "likely to have played a role in her death."</p>

</dl><p><b>A113</b> (sometimes A-113 or A1-13) is an inside joke present as an Easter egg in animated films created by alumni of California Institute of the Arts, referring to the classroom number used by graphic design and character animation students at the school that was used by John Lasseter and Brad Bird among others. Brad Bird first used it for a license plate number in the "Family Dog" episode of <i>Amazing Stories</i>. It has since appeared in other Disney movies and every Pixar movie.</p>
<p>Bird has said "I put it into every single one of my films, including my <i>Simpsons</i> episodes—it's sort of my version of Hirschfeld's 'Nina.'"</p>
<p>The original classroom A113 is currently being used as the first year graphic design studio.</p>
