  title: Audrey Hepburn
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Audrey Hepburn</b> (born <b>Audrey Kathleen Ruston</b>; 4 May 1929 – 20 January 1993) was a British actress and humanitarian. Recognised as a film and fashion icon, Hepburn was active during Hollywood's Golden Age. She was ranked by the American Film Institute as the third greatest female screen legend in the history of American cinema and has been placed in the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame. She is also regarded by some to be the most naturally beautiful woman of all time.</p>
    <p>Born in Ixelles, a district of Brussels, Hepburn spent her childhood between Belgium, England and the Netherlands, including German-occupied Arnhem during the Second World War. In Amsterdam, she studied ballet with Sonia Gaskell before moving to London in 1948 to continue her ballet training with Marie Rambert and perform as a chorus girl in West End musical theatre productions. She spoke several languages including English, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and German.</p>
    <p>After appearing in several British films and starring in the 1951 Broadway play <i>Gigi</i>, Hepburn played the Academy Award-winning lead role in <i>Roman Holiday</i> (1953). She went on to star in a number of successful films, such as <i>Sabrina</i> (1954), <i>The Nun's Story</i> (1959), <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> (1961), <i>Charade</i> (1963), <i>My Fair Lady</i> (1964) and <i>Wait Until Dark</i> (1967), for which she received Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations. For her role in <i>Roman Holiday</i>, Hepburn was also the first actress to win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for a single performance in 1954. The same year, she won a Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Play for <i>Ondine</i>. Hepburn remains one of few people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards. She won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role.</p>
    <p>She appeared in fewer films as her life went on, devoting much of her later life to UNICEF. Although contributing to the organisation since 1954, she worked in some of the most profoundly disadvantaged communities of Africa, South America and Asia between 1988 and 1992. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in December 1992. A month later, Hepburn died of appendiceal cancer at her home in Switzerland at the age of 63.<br></p>

  title: National Board for Prices and Incomes
  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>National Board for Prices and Incomes</b> was created by the government of Harold Wilson in 1965 in an attempt to solve the problem of inflation in the British economy by managing wages and prices.</p>
    <p>The Board's chairman was Aubrey Jones, formerly a Conservative MP, who resigned his seat to take the position. Amongst the other members was the academic Hugh Clegg. However, with the failure of George Brown's national economic plans, and especially after devaluation in 1967, wage control was consistently opposed by British trades unions, and eventually in 1970 Wilson proposed to merge the Board with the Monopolies Commission, with Jones at its head. In the event the 1971 General Election was won by the Conservatives, who scrapped the organization. Clegg wrote a book on his experience entitled <i>How to Run an Incomes Policy, and Why We Made Such a Mess of the Last One</i>. (1971).</p>

    <p><b>Java</b> (Indonesian: <i><b>Jawa</b></i>; Javanese: ꦗꦮ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population roughly equal to Russia as of 2014, (excluding the 3.7 million on the island of Madura which is administered as part of the province of East Java), Java is the world's most populous island, and one of the most densely populated places in the world. Java is the home of 57 percent of the Indonesian population. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 40s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.</p>
    <p>Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions, Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in Indonesia. A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east-west spine along the island. It has three main languages, with Javanese being the dominant language; it is the native language of about 60 million people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java. Most of its residents are bilingual, with Indonesian as their first or second languages. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java has a diverse mixture of religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.</p>
    <p>Java is divided into four provinces, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Banten, and also two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.</p>

  title: Penknife
  extract: |-
    <p>A <b>penknife</b>, or <b>pen knife</b>, is a small folding pocket knife, originally used for cutting or sharpening a quill to make a pen nib. Originally, penknives did not necessarily have folding blades, but resembled a scalpel or wood knife by having a short, fixed blade at the end of a long handle. These knives were used for thinning and pointing quills to prepare them for use as writing instruments and, later, for repairing or re-pointing the quills. They may also be used to whittle wood. Modern penknives may have single or multiple blades and additional tools incorporated into the design.</p>
    <p>Over the last hundred years, there has been a proliferation of multi-function knives with multifarious and often gadgets including awls, reamers, scissors, nail files, corkscrews, tweezers, toothpicks, and so on, and the tradition continues with the incorporation of modern devices such as ballpoint pens, LED flashlights, and USB flash drives.</p>
    <p>The most famous example of a multi-function knife is the Swiss Army knife, some versions of which number dozens of functions and are really more of a folding multi-tool, incorporating a blade or two, than a penknife with extras.</p>
    <p>A larger folding knife, especially one in which the blade locks into place, is often called a claspknife.</p>

  title: HNLMS Abraham Crijnssen (1936)
  extract: |-
    <p><b>HNLMS <i>Abraham Crijnssen</i></b> was a <i>Jan van Amstel</i>-class minesweeper of the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNN). Built during the 1930s, she was based in the Netherlands East Indies when Japan attacked at the end of 1941. Ordered to retreat to Australia, the ship was disguised as a tropical island to avoid detection, and was the last Dutch ship to escape from the region. On arriving in Australia in 1942, she was commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as <b>HMAS <i>Abraham Crijnssen</i></b> and operated as an anti-submarine escort. Although returned to RNN control in 1943, the ship remained in Australian waters for most of World War II. After the war, <i>Abraham Crijnssen</i> operated on anti-revolution patrols in the East Indies, before returning to the Netherlands and being converted into a boom defence ship in 1956. Removed from service in 1960, the vessel was donated to the Netherlands Sea Cadet Corps for training purposes. In 1995, <i>Abraham Crijnssen</i> was acquired by the Dutch Navy Museum for preservation as a museum ship.</p>

  title: Kentucky Derby
  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>Kentucky Derby</b> /ˈdɜrbi/ is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds, held annually in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, on the first Saturday in May, capping the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival. The race is one and a quarter miles (2 km) at Churchill Downs. Colts and geldings carry 126 pounds (57 kilograms) and fillies 121 pounds (55 kilograms). The race is known in the United States as "The Most Exciting Two Minutes In Sports" or "The Fastest Two Minutes in Sports" for its approximate duration, and is also called "The Run for the Roses" for the blanket of roses draped over the winner. It is the first leg of the US Triple Crown and is followed by the Preakness Stakes, then the Belmont Stakes. Unlike the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, which took hiatuses in 1891-1893 and 1911-1912, respectively, the Kentucky Derby has been run every consecutive year since 1875. A horse must win all three races to win the Triple Crown. The attendance at the Kentucky Derby ranks first in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes, and the Breeders' Cup.</p>

    <p><b>Jean-Dominique Bauby</b> (<small>French: </small>[ʒɑ̃ dɔminik bobi]; 23 April 1952 – 9 March 1997) was a well-known French journalist, author and editor of the French fashion magazine <i>ELLE</i>. He had two children with Sylvie de la Rochefoucauld, a son named Théophile and a daughter named Céleste.</p>
    <p>On 8 December 1995 at the age of 43, Bauby suffered a massive stroke. When he woke up twenty days later, he found he was entirely speechless; he could only blink his left eyelid. Called locked-in syndrome, this is a condition wherein the mental faculties remain intact but most of the body is paralyzed. In Bauby's case his mouth, arms, and legs were paralyzed, and he lost 27 kilograms (60 lb) in the first 20 weeks after his stroke.</p>

  title: Tenacious D
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Tenacious D</b> is an American comedy rock duo that was formed in Los Angeles, California, United States in 1994. Composed of lead vocalist and guitarist Jack Black and lead guitarist and vocalist Kyle Gass, the band has released three albums – <i>Tenacious D</i> (2001), <i>The Pick of Destiny</i> (2006) and <i>Rize of the Fenix</i> (2012). Tenacious D's studio releases, and (as of 2006) its live performances, feature a full band lineup, including such musicians as guitarist John Konesky and bassist John Spiker. Drummer Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters, Nirvana) played on every studio release, with Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman replacing Grohl on tour.</p>
    <p>The band first gained popularity in 1999 when they starred in their eponymous television series and began to support large rock acts. In 2001, they released <i>Tenacious D</i>, their debut album featuring a full band. The first single, "Tribute", was the band's most successful achieving their only Top 10 in any chart, until they released "The Metal", which was first shown at <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. In 2006, they starred in, and recorded the soundtrack for, the film <i>Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny</i>. In support of the film, the band went on a world tour, appearing for the first time with a full band. They released their newest album <i>Rize of the Fenix</i> on May 15, 2012.</p>
    <p>Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass' acoustic guitar playing abilities. Critics have described their fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as "mock rock". Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and cannabis usage in a style that music critics have compared with the storyteller-style lyrics of rock opera.</p>

  title: Circulatory system
  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>circulatory system</b> is an organ system that permits blood and lymph circulation to transport nutrients (such as amino acids and electrolytes), oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, blood cells, etc. to and from cells in the body to nourish it and help to fight diseases, stabilize body temperature and pH, and to maintain homeostasis.</p>
    <p>This system is often seen as strictly as a blood distribution network, but some consider the circulatory system to be composed collectively of the <b>cardiovascular system</b>, which distributes blood, and the <b>lymphatic system</b>, which circulates lymph. Blood is a fluid consisting of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system, carrying oxygen and nutrients to and waste materials away from all body tissues. Lymph is essentially recycled excess blood plasma after it has been filtered from the interstitial fluid (between cells) and returned to the lymphatic system. The cardiovascular (from Latin words meaning 'heart'-'vessel') system comprises the blood, heart, and blood vessels. The lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph vessels form the lymphatic system, which returns filtered blood plasma from the interstitial fluid (between cells) as lymph.</p>
    <p>While humans, as well as other vertebrates, have a closed cardiovascular system (meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries, veins and capillaries), some invertebrate groups have an open cardiovascular system. The lymphatic system, on the other hand, is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to get returned to the blood. The more primitive, diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory systems.</p>

  title: GmailFS
  extract: |
    <p><b>GmailFS</b> is a virtual file system originally developed by Richard Jones that uses a Gmail e-mail account for storage. GmailFS is written for Linux, but Windows and Mac OS X ports exist too. It originally was based on underlying SMTP and POP3 interaction with Gmail. Since May 16, 2010, a fork exists that uses IMAP.</p>
    <p>It works by building a filesystem with the Filesystem in Userspace loadable kernel module, and manages communication with Gmail through a special purpose Python library called libgmail. The actual GmailFS is also implemented in Python.</p>
    <p>The speed of this filesystem is limited by the speed of the user's Internet connection, and the upload/download speed of the Gmail server. Files can be any size, and are stored as (segmented) attachments.</p>
    <p>The Official website news dated 13 December 2009, says "Unfortunately the GmailFS project has come to an end. libgmail has ceased being maintained by its developers, and as a result libgmail no longer works with the latest Gmail interface (and has not done so for many weeks). Without a working libgmail, GmailFS does not function, so the end of libgmail also spells the end of GmailFS."</p>
