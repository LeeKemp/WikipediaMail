		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 27 February 2014 </h1><h2> Samoset</h2><p><b>Samoset</b> (ca. 1590–1653) was the first Native American to make contact with the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony. On March 16, 1621, the settlers were more than surprised when Samoset strolled straight through the middle of the encampment at Plymouth Colony and greeted them in English, which he had begun to learn from a group of English sailors who took Samoset from what is now Maine.</p>
<p>The orthography of Samoset's name varied depending on which Englishman was discussing him. Although he appeared as <i>Samoset</i> in some accounts, in others he appeared as <i>Somerset</i>. This odd Anglicisation of this American Indian name probably came naturally to English explorers, many of whom hailed from the West Country. Even Captain Christopher Levett, a Yorkshireman, referred to this Native American as <i>Somerset</i> in his account of his journey to explore New England in 1623 and 1624. Capt. Levett entertained Samoset, along with other Native American leaders, in 1624 in the harbor of present-day Portland, Maine.</p>

The Mahashivratri festival, also much popular as 'Shivratri' or 'Great Night of Lord Shiva', is observed on the 13th night/14th day in the Krishna Paksha every year on the month of Maagh according to the Hindu calendar. Alternate common spellings include <i>Sivaratri</i>, <i>Shivaratri</i>, <i>Sivarathri</i>, and <i>Shivarathri</i>. It marks the convergence of Shiva and Shakti. Maha Shivratri is celebrated on the Krishna Paksha Chaturdashi of Hindu calendar month Maagha which falls in February or March as per the Gregorian calendar. Of the twelve Shivaratris in the year, the MahaShivarathri is the most powerful.</p>
<p>The festival is principally celebrated by offerings of Bael or golden apple or <i>Bilva</i>/<i>Vilvam</i> leaves to Lord Shiva, all-day fasting and an all-night-long vigil (jagarana). All through the day, devotees chant "Om Namah Shivaya", a sacred Panchakshara mantra dedicated to Lord Shiva. In accordance with scriptural and discipleship traditions, penances are performed in order to gain boons in the practice of Yoga and meditation, in order to reach life's highest good steadily and swiftly. On this day, the planetary positions in the Northern hemisphere act as potent catalysts to help a person raise his / her spiritual energy easily. The benefits of powerful ancient Sanskrit Mantras such as Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra महामृत्युंजय मंत्र increase manifold on this night.</p>
<p>In Nepal, millions of Hindus attend Shivaratri together from different part of the world at the famous Pashupatinath Temple. Thousands of devotees also attend Mahasivaratri at the famous Shiva Shakti Peetham of Nepal.</p>
<p>On Mahashivratri, Nishita Kala is the ideal time to observe Shiva Pooja. Nishita Kala is the time when Lord Shiva appeared on the Earth in the form of Linga. On this day, in all Shiva temples, the most auspicious Lingodbhava puja is performed.</p>

The <b>Autonomous Republic of Crimea</b> (Ukrainian: Автономна Республіка Крим, <i>Avtonomna Respublika Krym</i>; Russian: Автономная Республика Крым, <i>Avtonomnaya Respublika Krym</i>; Crimean Tatar: <i>Qırım Muhtar Cumhuriyeti</i>, Къырым Мухтар Джумхуриети) occupies most of the peninsula. It is often referred to with the definite article, as <b>the Crimea</b>.</p>
<p>The territory of Crimea was conquered and controlled many times throughout its history. The Cimmerians, Greeks, Scythians, Goths, Huns, Bulgars, Khazars, the state of Kievan Rus', Byzantine Greeks, Kipchaks, Ottoman Turks, Golden Horde Tatars and the Mongols all controlled Crimea in its earlier history. In the 13th century, it was partly controlled by the Venetians and by the Genovese; they were followed by the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire in the 15th to 18th centuries, the Russian Empire in the 18th to 20th centuries, Germany during World War II and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and later the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, within the Soviet Union during the rest of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Crimea is now an autonomous parliamentary republic, within Ukraine, which is governed by the Constitution of Crimea in accordance with the laws of Ukraine. The capital and administrative seat of the republic's government is the city of Simferopol, located in the center of the peninsula. Crimea's area is 26,200 square kilometres (10,100 sq mi) and its population was 1,973,185 as of 2007. These figures do not include the area and population of the City of Sevastopol (2007 population: 379,200), which is administratively separate from the autonomous republic. The peninsula thus has 2,352,385 people (2007 estimate).</p>
<p>Crimean Tatars, an ethnic minority who in 2001 made up 12.1% of the population, formed in Crimea in the late Middle Ages, after the Crimean Khanate had come into existence. The Crimean Tatars were forcibly expelled to Central Asia by Joseph Stalin's government. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Crimean Tatars began to return to the region. According to the 2001 Ukrainian population census 58.5% of the population of Crimea were ethnic Russians and 24.4% were ethnic Ukrainians.<br></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea' >More...</a><hr><h2> Dice</h2><p><b>Dice</b> (singular <b>die</b> or <b>dice</b>; from French <i>dé</i>; from Latin <i>datum</i> "something which is given or played") are small throwable objects with multiple resting positions, used for generating random numbers. Dice are suitable as gambling devices for games like craps, and are also used in non-gambling tabletop games.</p>
<p>A traditional die is a rounded cube, with each of its six faces showing a different number of dots (pips) from 1 to 6. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing on its upper surface a random integer from one to six, each value being equally likely. A variety of similar devices are also described as dice; such specialized dice may have polyhedral or irregular shapes and may have faces marked with symbols instead of numbers. They may be used to produce results other than one through six. Loaded and crooked dice are designed to favor some results over others for purposes of cheating or amusement.</p>
<p>A <b>dice tray</b> or a <b>dicebox</b> is a piece of gaming equipment, a tray used to contain thrown dice, for gambling or board games. One traditional form used in Flemish dice games is an octagonal shaped wooden tray, lined with fabric. A dice tray can be used to play games on its own or as an add-on for other board games, in particular to allow dice throws which do not interfere with other game pieces.</p>
