Using the app, users can take photos, record videos, add text and drawings, and send them to a controlled list of recipients. These sent photographs and videos are known as "Snaps". Users set a time limit for how long recipients can view their Snaps (as of November 2013, the range is from 1 to 10 seconds), after which they will be hidden from the recipient's device and deleted from the Snapchat server.</p>

She is the self-proclaimed "Mistress of All Evil" who, after not being invited to a royal christening, curses the infant Princess Aurora to "prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die" before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday. The character is Disney's adaptation of the wicked fairy godmother from the original French fairy tale.</p>
<p>Maleficent has been called "one of the most menacing villains in the Disney canon". In Ultimate Disney's top 30 Disney Villains countdown, Maleficent ranked #1. She also plays a major role as a recurring villain in the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> series of role-playing games.</p>

It was first proclaimed by the World Conference for the Well-being of Children in 1925 and then established universally in 1954 to protect an "appropriate" day. Major global variants include a <b>Universal Children's Day</b> on November 20, by United Nations recommendation.</p>
<p>Children's Day is often celebrated on other days as well. International Day for Protection of Children, observed in many countries as Children's Day on June 1 since 1950, was established by the Women's International Democratic Federation on its congress in Moscow (22 November 1949).</p>

While often referred to as a comedian, Kaufman did not consider himself to be one. He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood, referring to himself instead as a “song-and-dance man.” Elaborate ruses and pranks were major elements of his career. His body of work maintains a cult following and he continues to be respected for his original material, performance style, and unflinching commitment to character.</p>

<p>Although the "GED" initialism is frequently mistaken as meaning "general education degree" or "general education diploma", the American Council on Education, which owns the GED trademark, coined the initialism to identify "tests of <b>g</b>eneral <b>e</b>ducational <b>d</b>evelopment" that measure proficiency in science, mathematics, social studies, reading, and writing. Passing the GED test gives those who did not complete high school the opportunity to earn their high school equivalency credential, but no state awards a "GED" per se.</p>
<p>The GED Testing Service, a joint venture of the American Council on Education and Pearson, is the sole developer for the GED test. The test can be taken by paper or on computer, but tests must be taken in person. Jurisdictions award a <b>Certificate of High School Equivalency</b> or similarly titled credential to persons who meet the passing score requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to English, the GED tests are available in Spanish, French, large print, audio cassette, and braille. Tests and test preparation are also offered to persons incarcerated and on military bases in addition to more traditional settings. Individuals living outside the United States, Canada, or U.S. territories may be eligible to take the GED tests through Pearson Vue testing centers.</p>

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Educational_Development' >More...</a><hr><h2> Financial services</h2><p><b>Financial services</b> are the economic services provided by the finance industry, which encompasses a broad range of organizations that manage money, including credit unions, banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, accountancy companies, consumer finance companies, stock brokerages, investment funds and some government sponsored enterprises.</p>
<p>As of 2004, the financial services industry represented 20% of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500 in the United States. The U.S. finance industry comprised only 10% of total non-farm business profits in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010. Over the same period, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%.</p>

Starring Angelina Jolie as the titular Disney Villain character, the film is a prequel and remake of Walt Disney's 1959 animated adaptation of <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>, and portrays the story from the perspective of the antagonist, Maleficent. It began filming on June 18, 2012, and is scheduled for release on May 30, 2014.</p>
<p><i>Maleficent</i> marked the directorial debut of production designer Robert Stromberg (<i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, <i>Avatar</i>, <i>Oz the Great and Powerful</i>) and the return of longtime Disney filmmaker and enthusiast Don Hahn as producer.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleficent_(film)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Saola</h2><p>The <b>Saola</b>, <b>Vu Quang ox</b> or <b>Asian unicorn</b>, also, infrequently, <b>Vu Quang bovid</b> (<i>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</i>), is one of the world's rarest mammals, a forest-dwelling bovine found only in the Annamite Range of Vietnam and Laos. Cousin to the cow, goat, and antelope, the species was defined following a discovery of remains in 1992 in Vũ Quang Nature Reserve by a joint survey of the Ministry of Forestry and the World Wide Fund for Nature. The team found three skulls with unusual long straight horns kept in hunters' houses. In their article, the team proposed "a three month survey to observe the living animal" but, more than 20 years later, there was still no reported sighting of a saola in the wild by a scientist. However, a living saola was photographed in the wild in September 2013 by a camera trap set by World Wildlife Fund and the Vietnamese government’s Forest Protection Department. Van Ngoc Thinh, the WWF's Vietnam country director, said, "This is a breathtaking discovery and renews hope for the recovery of the species."</p>
<p>In late August 2010, a saola was captured by villagers in Laos but died in captivity before government conservationists could arrange for it to be released back into the wild. The carcass is being studied with the hope that it will advance scientific understanding of the saola. Sometimes these animals get caught in snares that have been set to catch animals such as wild boar, sambar and muntjac deer that come to feed on the crops that the farmers have planted. This has become a problem especially with the illegal fur trade for medicines, restaurants and food markets. More than 26,651 snares have been removed from habitats that the Saola has lived in for years.</p>
