		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 21 December 2013 </h1><h2> Baba Gurgur</h2><p><b>Baba Gurgur</b> (Kurdish: <i>Babagurgur</i>, <small>lit.</small> "Father of Fire"; Arabic: بابا كركر‎; Turkish: <i>Babe Gurgur</i>) is a large oil field near the city of Kirkuk which was the first to be discovered in Northern Iraq in 1927.</p>
<p>It was considered the largest oil field in the world until the discovery of the Ghawar field in Saudi Arabia in 1948. Baba Gurgur is located 16 kilometers northwest of Arrapha and is famous for its Eternal Fire (Arabic: النار الازلية‎) located at the middle of its oil fields.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Gurgur' >More...</a><hr><h2> Winter solstice</h2><p><b>Winter Solstice</b> is an astronomical phenomenon occurring in December every year when Sun's elevation with respect to Earth reaches its lowest value (-25.5 degrees). It is accompanied by the longest day on South Pole and the longest night on North Pole of Earth. In 2013, it occurs at 17:11 UTC on December 21.</p>
<p>For the Northern Hemisphere, at the moment of winter solstice, the sun is at its greatest height as observed from the South Pole. Similarly, for the Southern Hemisphere, at the moment of the winter solstice, the sun is at its greatest height as observed from the North Pole.  In the Northern Hemisphere the winter solstice is also the Southern solstice and occurs in December, In the Southern Hemisphere this is the Northern solstice which occurs in June.</p>
<p>Depending on one's position on the globe, the December solstice usually occurs on the 21st and the 22nd and the June solstice usually occurs on June the 20th or 21st. However, it is sometimes possible for a solstice to coincide with three different dates. Thus the December 2016 solstice coincides with 20th of the month in American Samoa, with the 21st in London and with the 22nd at Kiritimati.</p>
<p>The axial tilt of Earth and gyroscopic effects of the planet's daily rotation keep the axis of rotation pointed at the same point in the sky. As the Earth follows its orbit around the Sun, the same hemisphere that faced away from the Sun, experiencing winter, will, in half a year, face towards the Sun and experience summer. Since the two hemispheres face opposite directions along the planetary pole, as one polar hemisphere experiences winter, the other experiences summer.</p>
<p>More evident from high latitudes, a hemisphere's winter solstice occurs on the shortest day and longest night of the year, when the sun's daily maximum elevation in the sky is the lowest. The winter solstice itself lasts only a moment in time, so other terms are used for the day on which it occurs, such as "midwinter", or "the shortest day". For the same reason, it should not be confused with "the first day of winter" or "the start of winter" (Lidong in the East Asian calendars). The seasonal significance of the winter solstice is in the reversal of the gradual lengthening of nights and shortening of days. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates differ from winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see earliest and latest sunrise and sunset).</p>
<p>Worldwide, interpretation of the event has varied from culture to culture, but many cultures have held a recognition of rebirth, involving holidays, festivals, gatherings, rituals or other celebrations around that time.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice' >More...</a><hr><h2> Penn Jillette</h2><p><b>Penn Fraser Jillette</b> (born March 5, 1955) is an American illusionist, comedian, musician, actor, and best-selling author known for his work with fellow magician Teller in the team Penn &amp; Teller. He is also known for his advocacy of atheism, scientific skepticism, libertarianism and free-market capitalism.</p>

"tall-footed crab"), <i>Macrocheira kaempferi</i>, is a species of marine crab that lives in the waters around Japan. It has the largest leg span of any arthropod, reaching up to 3.8 metres (12 ft) and weighing up to 41 pounds (19 kg). It is the subject of small-scale fishery which has led to a few conservation measures.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_spider_crab' >More...</a><hr><h2> Crysis</h2><p><i><b>Crysis</b></i> is a first-person shooter video game developed by Crytek, published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows and released in November 2007. It is the first game of a trilogy. A separate game entitled <i>Crysis Warhead</i> was released on September 16, 2008, and follows similar events as Crysis but from a different narrative perspective. At the time <i>Crysis</i> was released, and years thereafter, it has been praised for its milestones in graphical design (commensurate with high hardware requirements).</p>
<p>The game is based in a future where a massive ancient space alien-constructed structure has been discovered buried inside a mountain on an island in the fictional Lingshan Islands, near the coast of the East Philippines. The single-player campaign has the player assume the role of U.S. Army Delta Force soldier Jake Dunn, referred to in-game by his callsign, Nomad. Nomad is armed with various futuristic weapons and equipment, most notably a "Nano Suit" which was inspired by a real-life military concept. In <i>Crysis</i>, the player fights both North Korean and extraterrestrial enemies in various environments on and around the island.</p>

This region is defined as a bioregion. They are a popular tourist destination. The lakes are long and narrow (resembling fingers), and are oriented roughly on a north-south axis. The two longest, Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake, are among the deepest in America. Both are close to 40 miles (64 km) from end to end, and never more than 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide. Cayuga is the longest (38.1 miles, 61 km) and Seneca the largest in total area. Seneca is the deepest (618 feet, 188 m), followed by Cayuga (435 feet, 133 m), with their bottoms well below sea level. These largest lakes resemble the others in shape, which collectively reminded early map-makers of human fingers. Oneida Lake is generally not considered one of the Finger Lakes, but it is sometimes called the "thumb", while Seneca Lake is the middle finger.</p>

He spent almost eight years as a Prisoner of War (POW) in North Vietnam and later wrote a book which became a film about those experiences.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Denton' >More...</a><hr><h2> Mikhail Khodorkovsky</h2><p><b>Mikhail Borisovich Khodorkovsky</b> (Russian: Михаи́л Бори́сович Ходорко́вский, <small>IPA: </small>[mʲɪxɐˈil xədɐˈrkofskʲɪj]; born 26 June 1963) is a Russian businessman, an oligarch, a philanthropist, a public figure and an author.</p>
<p>In 2003, Khodorkovsky was named Person of the Year by <i>Expert</i>, sharing this title with Roman Abramovich and, in 2004, Khodorkovsky was the wealthiest man in Russia and one of the richest people in the world, ranked 16th on Forbes list of billionaires.</p>
<p>Khodorkovsky had worked his way up the Communist apparatus during the Soviet years, and began several businesses during the era of <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i>. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he accumulated wealth through the development of Siberian oil fields as the head of Yukos, one of the largest Russian companies to emerge from the privatization of state assets during the 1990s.</p>
<p>He was arrested on 25 October 2003, to appear before investigators as a witness, but within hours of being taken into custody he was charged with fraud. The government under Vladimir Putin then froze shares of Yukos shortly thereafter on tax charges. The state took further actions against Yukos, leading to a collapse of the company's share price and the evaporation of much of Khodorkovsky's wealth. He was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison in May 2005. While still serving his sentence, Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev were further charged and found guilty of embezzlement and money laundering in December 2010, extending his prison sentence to 2014. Khodorkovsky was pardoned by President Vladimir Putin following lobbying for his release by Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and released from jail on 20 December 2013.</p>
<p>There is widespread concern internationally that the trials and sentencing were politically motivated. The trial process has received criticism from abroad for its lack of due process. Khodorkovsky has lodged several applications to the European Court of Human Rights, seeking redress for alleged violations by Russia of his human rights. In response to his first application, which concerned events from 2003 to 2005, the court found that several violations were committed by the Russian authorities in their treatment of Khodorkovsky. In particular, the court ruled that Khodorkovsky's arrest was "unlawful as it had been made with a purpose different from the one expressed." Despite these findings, the court ultimately ruled that the trial was not politically motivated, but rather "that the charges against him were grounded in 'reasonable suspicion'".</p>
<p>He was considered to be a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International.</p>
