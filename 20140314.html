		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 14 March 2014 </h1><h2> Information retrieval</h2><p><b>Information retrieval</b> is the activity of obtaining information resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources. Searches can be based on metadata or on full-text (or other content-based) indexing.</p>
<p>Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called "information overload". Many universities and public libraries use IR systems to provide access to books, journals and other documents. Web search engines are the most visible IR applications.</p>

It can be created by mixing green with blue into a white base, or deepened as needed with a little bit of black or gray color. The complementary color of teal is coral. It is also one of the initial group of 16 HTML/CSS web colors formulated in 1987.</p>
<p>The first recorded use of Teal as a color name in English was in 1917.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal' >More...</a><hr><h2> Tony Benn</h2><p><b>Anthony Neil Wedgwood "Tony" Benn</b>, PC (3 April 1925 – 14 March 2014), formerly <b>2nd Viscount Stansgate</b>, was a British Labour Party politician who was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 50 years and a Cabinet Minister under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan.</p>
<p>Benn's campaign to renounce his hereditary peerage was instrumental in the creation of the Peerage Act 1963. In the Labour Government of 1964–1970 he served first as Postmaster General, where he oversaw the opening of the Post Office Tower, and later as a notably "technocratic" Minister of Technology. In the period when the Labour Party was in Opposition, for a year he was the Chairman of the Labour Party. In the Labour Government of 1974–1979 he returned to the Cabinet, initially as Secretary of State for Industry, before being made Secretary of State for Energy, retaining his post when James Callaghan replaced Wilson as Prime Minister. During the Labour Party's time in Opposition during the 1980s, he was seen as the party's prominent figure on the left, and the term "Bennite" has come to be used in Britain for someone of a more radical left-wing position.</p>
<p>Benn topped several polls as the most popular politician in the UK. Benn has been described as "one of the few UK politicians to have become more left-wing after holding ministerial office." After leaving Parliament, Benn became involved in the grass-roots politics of demonstrations and meetings, and was the President of the Stop the War Coalition from 2003 until his death.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Benn' >More...</a><hr><h2> Pi</h2><p>The number <b>π</b> is a mathematical constant, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159. It has been represented by the Greek letter "π" since the mid-18th century though it is also sometimes spelled out as "<b>pi</b>" (/paɪ/).</p>
<p>Being an irrational number, π cannot be expressed exactly as a common fraction. Consequently its decimal representation never ends and never settles into a permanent repeating pattern. The digits appear to be randomly distributed although no proof of this has yet been discovered. Also, π is a transcendental number – a number that is not the root of any nonzero polynomial having rational coefficients. This transcendence of π implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straight-edge.</p>
<p>Fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to approximate π.</p>
<p>For thousands of years mathematicians have attempted to extend their understanding of π, sometimes by computing its value to a high degree of accuracy. Before the 15th century mathematicians such as Archimedes and Liu Hui used geometrical techniques, based on polygons, to estimate the value of π. Starting around the 15th century, new algorithms based on infinite series revolutionized the computation of π. In the 20th and 21st centuries mathematicians and computer scientists discovered new approaches that, when combined with increasing computational power, extended the decimal representation of π to, as of late 2011, over 10 trillion (10<sup>13</sup>) digits. Scientific applications generally require no more than 40 digits of π so the primary motivation for these computations is the human desire to break records but the extensive calculations involved have been used to test supercomputers and high-precision multiplication algorithms.</p>
<p>Because its definition relates to the circle π is found in many formulae in trigonometry and geometry, especially those concerning circles, ellipses or spheres. It is also found in formulae used in other branches of science such as cosmology, number theory, statistics, fractals, thermodynamics, mechanics and electromagnetism. The ubiquity of π makes it one of the most widely-known mathematical constants both inside and outside the scientific community: Several books devoted to it have been published, the number is celebrated on Pi Day and record-setting calculations of the digits of π often result in news headlines. Attempts to memorize the value of π with increasing precision have led to records of over 67,000 digits.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi' >More...</a><hr><h2> March 13</h2><p><b>March 13</b> is the 72nd day of the year (73rd in leap years) in the Gregorian calendar.

Most are part of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Union Territory of India, while a small number in the north of the archipelago, including the Coco Islands, belong to Burma.</p>
