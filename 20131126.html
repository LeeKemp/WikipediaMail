		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 26 November 2013 </h1><h2> Life of Brian (Family Guy)</h2><p>"<b>Life of Brian</b>" is the sixth episode of the twelfth season and the 216th overall episode of the animated comedy series <i>Family Guy</i>. It aired on Fox in the United States and Canada on November 24, 2013, and is written by Alex Carter and directed by Joseph Lee. The episode revolves around the death of Brian Griffin, after being struck by a car, and the family coping with the loss by adopting a replacement dog, Vinny.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Brian_(Family_Guy)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Flexible glass</h2><p><b>Flexible glass</b> is a legendary lost invention from the time of the reign of the Roman Emperor Tiberius Caesar (between 14–37 AD). As recounted by Isidore of Seville, the craftsman who invented the technique brought a drinking bowl made of flexible glass before Caesar who threw it to the floor, whereupon the material dented, rather than shattering. The inventor then repaired the bowl easily with a small hammer. After the inventor swore to the Emperor that he alone knew the technique of manufacture, Tiberius had the man beheaded, fearing such material could undermine the value of gold and silver.</p>
<p>The story of the sad fate of the inventor of unbreakable glass (vitrum flexile) at the hands of Tiberius (42 BC–37 AD) was first related by two more-or-less contemporary compilers, namely Petronius (c. 27–66 AD, Satyricon 51) and Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD, Naturalis Historia XXXVI.lxvi.195). Pliny apparently did not believe in vitrum flexile, remarking that the story is more frequently told than it is reliable. Cassius Dio (c. AD 150–235, Historia Romana 57.21.7) also told a similar story, writing that ‘an architect whose name no one knows’ whom Tiberius had exiled out of jealousy for his skill, ‘approached him to crave pardon, and while doing so purposely let fall a crystal goblet; and though it was bruised in some way or shattered, yet by passing his hands over it he promptly exhibited it whole once more. For this he hoped to obtain pardon, but instead the emperor put him to death.’ The story was picked up and retold by Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636, Etymologiae XVI.16.6, ‘De vitro’). Subsequently the thirteenth century collection of technical recipes by the pseudo-Heraclius included this story, in the section treating glass recipes, using Isidore’s own words (De coloribus et artibus Romanorum III.vi [256]). This is thus an example of ‘technical knowledge’ wending its way from historical gossip (Petronius), to a technical encyclopaedia (Pliny, with reservations), and then via a philological text (Isidore) to a collection of practical craft recipes (pseudo-Heraclius).</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_glass' >More...</a><hr><h2> Thanksgiving</h2><p><b>Thanksgiving Day</b> (<i>Jour de l'Action de grâce</i> in Canadian French) is a national holiday celebrated primarily in the United States and Canada as a day of giving thanks for the blessing of the harvest and of the preceding year. Several other places around the world observe similar celebrations. It is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States and on the second Monday of October in Canada. Thanksgiving has its historical roots in religious and cultural traditions, and has long been celebrated in a secular manner as well.</p>

The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.</p>
<p>The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, <i>The Life of Larry</i> and <i>Larry &amp; Steve</i>. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox on May 15, 1998. The show was given the green light and started production. Shortly after the third season of <i>Family Guy</i> aired in 2001, Fox cancelled the series, putting the series to a 2-year hiatus. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a 4th season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.</p>
<p><i>Family Guy</i> has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since <i>The Flintstones</i> in 1961. <i>Family Guy</i> has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons for its similarities to <i>The Simpsons</i>.</p>
<p>Many tie-in media have been released, including <i>Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story</i>, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; <i>Family Guy: Live in Vegas</i>, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the <i>Family Guy</i> universe; and <i>Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy</i> (2010), a series of parodies of the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation. A spin-off series, <i>The Cleveland Show</i>, featuring Cleveland Brown, aired from September 27, 2009 to May 19, 2013. "The Simpsons Guy", a crossover episode with <i>The Simpsons</i>, is scheduled to air in Fall 2014. <i>Family Guy</i> is a joint production by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television. </p>

He is most known for his roles in various popular films, including playing the title characters of the films <i>Wayne's World</i>, <i>Austin Powers</i>, <i>Shrek</i>, and <i>The Cat in the Hat</i>.

<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Myers' >More...</a><hr><h2> List of Family Guy episodes</h2><p><i>Family Guy</i> is an American animated television sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the dysfunctional Griffin family, which consists of father Peter (MacFarlane), mother Lois (Alex Borstein), daughter Meg (Mila Kunis; Lacey Chabert, 1999; Rachael MacFarlane, pilot), son Chris (Seth Green), baby Stewie (MacFarlane) and Brian (MacFarlane), the family dog. The show is set in the fictional town of Quahog, Rhode Island, and lampoons American culture, often in the form of cutaway gags, and tangential vignettes.</p>
<p>The concept of <i>Family Guy</i> was conceived by MacFarlane in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design. He created two shorts entitled <i>The Life of Larry</i> and <i>Larry &amp; Steve</i>, both of which played a key role in Fox executives' decision to pick up the series in 1998. After two seasons, Fox decided to cancel the show. Despite the cancellation, a third season was produced, after which the series was officially canceled at the end of 2003. Reruns on Cartoon Network's block Adult Swim drove up interest, and a letter-writing campaign, along with impressive DVD sales, encouraged Fox to bring the show back permanently. <i>Family Guy</i> returned to production in 2005, and is contracted to continue producing episodes until at least 2013. In May 2013, <i>Family Guy</i> was renewed for an 12th season in 2013/14.</p>
<p><i>Family Guy</i> and its cast have been nominated for thirteen Emmy Awards, with four wins. MacFarlane won the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance award for his performance as Stewie, Murphy and MacFarlane won the Outstanding Music and Lyrics award for the song "You Got a Lot to See" from the episode "Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows", Steven Fonti won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode "No Chris Left Behind", and Greg Colton won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode "Road to the Multiverse". The show was nominated for eleven Annies, and won three times, twice in 2006 and once in 2008. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in this category since <i>The Flintstones</i> in 1961.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Family_Guy_episodes' >More...</a><hr><h2> Thanksgiving (United States)</h2><p><b>Thanksgiving</b>, or <b>Thanksgiving Day</b>, is a holiday celebrated in the United States on the fourth Thursday in November. It became an official Federal holiday in 1863, when, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of "Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens", to be celebrated on Thursday, November 26. As a federal and public holiday in the U.S., Thanksgiving is one of the major holidays of the year. Together with Christmas and New Year, Thanksgiving is a part of the broader holiday season.</p>
<p>The event that Americans commonly call the "First Thanksgiving" was celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World in 1621. This feast lasted three days, and it was attended by 90 Native Americans (as accounted by attendee Edward Winslow) and 53 Pilgrims. The New England colonists were accustomed to regularly celebrating "thanksgivings"—days of prayer thanking God for blessings such as military victory or the end of a drought.</p>
