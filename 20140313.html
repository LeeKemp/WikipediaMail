		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 13 March 2014 </h1><h2> GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)</h2><p><i><b>GoldenEye 007</b></i> is a first-person shooter video game developed by Rare and based on the 1995 James Bond film <i>GoldenEye</i>. It was exclusively released for the Nintendo 64 video game console on 25 August 1997. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game also includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.</p>
<p><i>GoldenEye 007</i> was originally conceived as an on-rails shooter inspired by Sega's <i>Virtua Cop</i>, before being redesigned as a free-roaming shooter. The game received highly positive reviews from the gaming media and sold over eight million copies worldwide, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. <i>GoldenEye 007</i> is considered an important game in the history of first-person shooters for demonstrating the viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signaling a transition from the then-standard <i>Doom</i>-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and the incorporation of a console multiplayer deathmatch mode.</p>
<p><i>GoldenEye 007</i> was followed by a spiritual successor, <i>Perfect Dark</i>, also developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64. A reimagining of the game, also titled <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, was published by Activision and released for the Wii and Nintendo DS in 2010, and later re-released as <i>GoldenEye 007: Reloaded</i> for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 the following year.</p>
