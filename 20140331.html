		<h1>Popular Pages - Monday 31 March 2014 </h1><h2> Ketchup</h2><p><b>Ketchup</b> (/ˈkɛtʃəp/ or /ˈkɛtʃʌp/), also <b>catsup</b>, is a table sauce. As far back as 300 BC, different recipes featured ketchup made of mushrooms, oysters, mussels, walnuts, or other foods,  but in modern times the term without modification usually means tomato ketchup, sometimes called <b>tomato sauce</b>, or <b>red sauce</b>. It is a sweet and tangy sauce, typically made from tomatoes, vinegar, a sweetener, and assorted seasonings and spices. The sweetener is most commonly sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Seasonings vary by recipe, but commonly include onions, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, garlic, and celery.</p>
<p>Tomato ketchup is often used as a condiment with various dishes that are usually served hot, including french fries (chips), hamburgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, eggs, and grilled or fried meat. Ketchup is sometimes used as a basis or ingredient for other sauces and dressings. Mushroom ketchup is widely available in the UK.</p>

Most definitions of the term specify that automobiles are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods.</p>
<p>The year 1886 is regarded the year of birth of the modern automobile - with the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, by German inventor Karl Benz. Motorized wagons soon replaced animal-drafted carriages, especially after automobiles became affordable for many people when the Ford Model T was introduced in 1908.</p>
<p>The term <i>motorcar</i> has formerly also been used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage. These locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems.</p>
<p>It was estimated in 2010 that the number of automobiles had risen to over 1 billion vehicles, up from the 500 million of 1986. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other NICs.</p>
