		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 12 February 2014 </h1><h2> Carlos Lehder</h2><p><b>Carlos Enrique Lehder Rivas</b> or simply <b>Carlos Lehder</b> (born September 7, 1949) is a Colombian drug dealer currently imprisoned in the United States, having been co-founder of the Medellín Cartel. Born in Armenia, Colombia, Lehder eventually ran a cocaine transport empire on Norman's Cay island, 210 miles (340 km) off the Florida coast in the central Bahamas. Lehder was allegedly also active in the Quintín Lamé Movement, an indigenous guerrilla organization tied to the Colombian 19th of April Movement and FARC insurgencies.</p>
<p>Lehder was also a founding member of Muerte a Secuestradores, a paramilitary group whose focus was to retaliate against the kidnappings of cartel members and their families. He was one of the most important operators therein, and is considered to be one of the most important Colombian drug kingpins to be successfully prosecuted in the United States. In the 2001 movie <i>Blow</i>, the character Diego Delgado was based on him. Lehder is of mixed German-Colombian descent, his father a German engineer and mother a Colombian schoolteacher. The family owned a semi-legitimate used car business in the Medellin area in which Carlos got his start as a criminal by supplying it with stolen American cars.</p>

It consists of a conductor such as a wire, usually wound into a coil. When a current flows through it, energy is stored temporarily in a magnetic field in the coil. When the current flowing through an inductor changes, the time-varying magnetic field induces a voltage in the conductor, according to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, which opposes the change in current that created it.</p>
<p>An inductor is characterized by its <i>inductance</i>, the ratio of the voltage to the rate of change of current, which has units of henries (H). Inductors have values that typically range from 1 µH (10<sup>-6</sup>H) to 1 H. Many inductors have a magnetic core made of iron or ferrite inside the coil, which serves to increase the magnetic field and thus the inductance. Along with capacitors and resistors, inductors are one of the three passive linear circuit elements that make up electric circuits. Inductors are widely used in alternating current (AC) electronic equipment, particularly in radio equipment. They are used to block the flow of AC current while allowing DC to pass; inductors designed for this purpose are called chokes. They are also used in electronic filters to separate signals of different frequencies, and in combination with capacitors to make tuned circuits, used to tune radio and TV receivers.</p>

He is a two-time Olympic gold medalist. He holds the X-Games records for gold medals and highest overall medal count, and has won 10 ESPY Awards.</p>

The story follows the main character Elizabeth Bennet as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of early 19th-century England. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman living near the fictional town of Meryton in Hertfordshire, near London.</p>
<p>Though the story is set at the turn of the 19th century, it retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of "most loved books" such as The Big Read. It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen's memorable characters or themes. To date, the book has sold some 20 million copies worldwide.</p>
<p>As Anna Quindlen wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is also about that thing that all great novels consider, the search for self. And it is the first great novel that teaches us this search is as surely undertaken in the drawing room making small talk as in the pursuit of a great white whale or the public punishment of adultery.</p>

She is the daughter of Shirley Temple and Charles Alden Black. She played bass for Clown Alley and for the Melvins. She has since stopped performing, and has become a photographer.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lori_Black' >More...</a><hr><h2> Ego death</h2><p><b>Ego death</b> is an experience that makes known the illusory aspect of the ego (Ahamkara), which can be experienced by individuals.</p>
<p>The occultic practice of ego death as "mystical experience" variously overlaps with, but is distinct from, traditions concerning Buddhist enlightenment and Nirvana (in Buddhism), or Moksha (in Hinduism and Jainism). These latter concepts are understood as transcendence of the notion of non-illusory ego with which to experience death.</p>
