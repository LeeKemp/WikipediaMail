  title: Memorial Day
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Memorial Day</b> is a US federal holiday wherein the men and women who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces are remembered. The holiday, which is celebrated every year on the final Monday of May, was formerly known as <b>Decoration Day</b> and originated after the American Civil War to commemorate the Union and Confederate soldiers who died in the Civil War. By the 20th century, Memorial Day had been extended to honor all Americans who have died while in the military service. It typically marks the start of the summer vacation season, while Labor Day marks its end.</p>
    <p>Many people visit cemeteries and memorials, particularly to honor those who have died in military service. Many volunteers place an American flag on each grave in national cemeteries.</p>
    <p>Annual Decoration Days for particular cemeteries are held on a Sunday in late spring or early summer in some rural areas of the American South, notably in the mountains. In cases involving a family graveyard where remote ancestors as well as those who were deceased more recently are buried, this may take on the character of an extended family reunion to which some people travel hundreds of miles. People gather on the designated day and put flowers on graves and renew contacts with kinfolk and others. There often is a religious service and a "dinner on the ground," the traditional term for a potluck meal in which people used to spread the dishes out on sheets or tablecloths on the grass. It is believed that this practice began before the American Civil War and thus may reflect the real origin of the "memorial day" idea.</p>
    <p>Memorial Day is not to be confused with Veterans Day; Memorial Day is a day of remembering the men and women who died while serving, while Veterans Day celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans.</p>

    <p>The <i><b>X-Men</b></i> film series consists of superhero films based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. 20th Century Fox obtained the film rights to the characters in 1994, and after numerous drafts, Bryan Singer was hired to direct <i>X-Men</i> (2000) and its sequel, <i>X2</i> (2003). Singer left the potential third and fourth films, leaving Brett Ratner to direct <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> (2006). <i>X-Men</i> and <i>X2</i> were met with positive reviews for their dark, realistic tone and subtexts dealing with discrimination and intolerance, while <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> was met with mixed reviews.</p>
    <p>After each film earned higher box-office grosses than its predecessor, three spin-off films were released. <i>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</i> (2009), directed by Gavin Hood, features Wolverine's origin story. <i>X-Men: First Class</i> (2011), directed by Matthew Vaughn, focuses on the origins of Professor X and Magneto. <i>The Wolverine</i> (2013), directed by James Mangold, follows Wolverine after the events of <i>The Last Stand</i>. <i>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</i> was met with negative reviews from critics, while <i>X-Men: First Class</i> and <i>The Wolverine</i> were received more positively.</p>
    <p>The seventh film, <i>X-Men: Days of Future Past</i> (2014) featured the return of the original trilogy cast and Singer as the director. Serving as a dual sequel to both <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> and <i>X-Men: First Class</i>, it was met with critical acclaim.</p>
    <p>With seven films released, the <i>X-Men</i> film series is the 15th highest-grossing film franchise, having grossed over $2 billion worldwide. It is set to continue with <i>X-Men: Apocalypse</i> (2016), a sequel to <i>Days of Future Past</i> and a third <i>Wolverine</i> film (2017).</p>

  title: UEFA Champions League
  extract: |-
    <p>we <b>UEFA Champions League</b> /juːˈeɪfə ˈtʃæmpiənz ˈliːɡ/, known simply as the <b>Champions League</b>, is an annual continental club football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) since 1992. It replaced the <b>European Champion Clubs' Cup</b>, or simply <b>European Cup</b>, which had run since 1955, adding a group stage to the competition and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries. It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football. The final of the 2012–13 tournament was the most watched UEFA Champions League final to date, as well as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide in 2013, drawing 360 million television viewers.</p>
    <p>Before 1992, the competition was officially called the "European Champion Clubs' Cup", but was usually referred to simply as the "European Cup". It was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champion club of each country. During the 1990s, the format was expanded, incorporating a round-robin group stage and more teams. Europe's strongest national leagues now provide up to four teams for the competition, and will provide up to five teams from the 2015–16 season onwards.</p>
    <p>In its present format, the UEFA Champions League begins in mid-July with three knockout qualifying rounds and a play-off round. The 10 surviving teams enter the group stage, joining 22 other teams qualified in advance. The 32 teams are drawn into eight groups of four teams and play each other in a double round-robin system. The eight group winners and eight runners-up proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in May. The winner of the UEFA Champions League qualifies for the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
    <p>Real Madrid is the most successful club in the competition's history, having won the tournament ten times, including its first five seasons. Spanish clubs have accumulated the highest number of victories (14 wins), followed by England and Italy (12 wins apiece). The competition has been won by 22 different clubs, 12 of which have won it more than once. Since the tournament changed name and structure in 1992, no club has managed consecutive wins; Milan were the last holders to successfully defend their title, in the 1989–90 season. The reigning champions are Real Madrid, who secured their tenth win in the competition after defeating Atlético Madrid 4–1 in the 2014 Final.<br></p>

    <p><b>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro</b>, <small>OIH</small> (born 5 February 1985), known as <b>Cristiano Ronaldo</b>, is a Portuguese footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club Real Madrid and captains the Portugal national team. He became the most expensive footballer in history when he moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth £80 million (€94 million/$132 million). Ronaldo's contract with Real Madrid, under the terms of which he is paid €21 million per year (after taxes), makes him the highest-paid footballer in the world, and his buyout clause is valued at €1 billion as per his contract.</p>
    <p>Ronaldo began his career as a youth player for Andorinha, where he played for 2 years, before moving to C.D. Nacional. In 1997, he made a move to Portuguese giants Sporting Clube de Portugal. Ronaldo caught the attention of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who signed him for £12.2 million (€15 million) in 2003. In 2004, Ronaldo won his first club honour, the FA Cup.</p>
    <p>In 2007, Ronaldo was the first player in England to win all 4 main PFA and FWA awards. In 2008 and 2013, he won the FIFA/Ballon d'Or award for the best footballer in the world, the first Portuguese player to win the award twice. He was awarded the European Golden Shoe in 2008, 2011 and 2014. In 2008, he won 3 of the 4 main PFA and FWA trophies and was named the FIFA World Player of the Year, FIFPro Player of the Year, World Soccer Player of the Year, and the Onze d'Or. In 2007 and 2008, Ronaldo was named FWA Footballer of the Year. He was the inaugural winner of the FIFA Puskás Award for Goal of the Year in 2009. In a 2014 UEFA poll, Ronaldo was named the greatest goalscorer to play in the UEFA Champions League.</p>
    <p>Ronaldo is the first top European league player to reach 40 goals in a single season in two consecutive years, fastest Real Madrid player to reach 100 league goals, and the first player to score against every team in a single season in La Liga. He holds the record for most goals scored in a season for Real Madrid. In January 2014, Ronaldo scored his 400th career goal. After spending his first year at Madrid wearing the number 9 shirt, he began wearing the number 7 again following the departure of long-serving striker Raúl. Ronaldo had previously worn the number 7 shirt at Manchester United.</p>
    <p>Ronaldo is a Portuguese international and made his debut in August 2003. He has been capped over 100 times and is Portugal's top goalscorer of all time. With Portugal he has participated in 5 major tournaments; UEFA Euro 2004, the 2006 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2008, the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012. He scored his first international goal in the opening game of Euro 2004 against Greece, in addition to helping Portugal reach the final. He took over captaincy in July 2008 and captained them to the Euro 2012 semi-finals finishing the competition as joint-top scorer.</p>

    <p><b>Club Atlético de Madrid, SAD</b> (<small>Spanish pronunciation: </small>[ˈkluβ aðˈletiko ðe maˈðɾið]), commonly known as <b>Atlético de Madrid</b>, or <b>Atlético</b>, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid that plays in La Liga, where they are the current champions.</p>
    <p>Atlético have won La Liga on ten occasions, including a league and cup double in 1996; the Copa del Rey on ten occasions; 1 Supercopa de España and 3 Copa Eva Duarte; in Europe, they won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1962, were European Cup runners-up in 1974 and 2014, won the Europa League in 2010 and in 2012, and won the UEFA Super Cup in 2010 and 2012, as well as the 1974 Intercontinental Cup.</p>
    <p>The club play their home games at the Vicente Calderón, which holds up to 54,960 spectators. In 2016, Atletico are due to move to their new home of Estadio La Peineta, which will have a capacity of 70,000.</p>
    <p>Atletico's home kit is red and white vertical striped shirts, with blue shorts, accompanied by blue and red socks. This combination has been used since 1911. The current club kits are manufactured by Nike and sponsored by Azerbaijan.</p>
    <p>During their history, the club has been known by a number of nicknames, including <i>Los Colchoneros</i> ("The Mattress Makers" in English), due to their first team stripes being the same colours as old-fashioned mattresses. During the 1970s, they became known as <i>Los Indios</i>, allegedly due to the club signing several South American players after the restrictions on signing foreign players was lifted. However, there are a number of alternative theories which claim they were named so because their stadium is "camped" on the river bank, or because <i>Los Indios</i> (The Indians) were the traditional enemy of <i>Los Blancos</i> (The Whites), which is the nickname of the club's city rivals, Real Madrid.</p>
