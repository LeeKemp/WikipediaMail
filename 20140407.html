		<h1>Popular Pages - Monday 07 April 2014 </h1><h2> Mickey Rooney</h2><p><b>Mickey Rooney</b> (born <b>Joseph Yule, Jr.</b>; September 23, 1920 – April 6, 2014) was an American film actor and entertainer whose film, television, and stage appearances spanned nearly his entire lifetime.</p>
<p>He received multiple awards, including a Juvenile Academy Award, an Honorary Academy Award, two Golden Globes and an Emmy Award. Working as a performer since he was a child, he was a superstar as a teenager for the films in which he played Andy Hardy, and he had one of the longest careers of any actor, spanning 92 years actively making films in ten decades, from the 1920s to the 2010s. For a younger generation of fans, he gained international fame for his leading role as Henry Dailey in The Family Channel's <i>The Adventures of the Black Stallion</i>.</p>
<p>Until his death in April 2014, Rooney was one of the last surviving stars who worked in the silent film era. He was also the last surviving cast member of several films in which he appeared during the 1930s and 1940s.</p>

It was designed and built by the British company Vickers Defence Systems (now known as BAE Systems Land and Armaments).</p>

An employee of the company since 1990, he is its most tenured performer, and the only remaining active competitor from the very first episode of <i>WWE Raw</i> in 1993. Calaway began his wrestling career with World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) in 1984. He joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as <b>"Mean" Mark Callous</b> in 1989. When WCW did not renew Calaway's contract in 1990, he signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). After debuting as <b>Kane the Undertaker</b>, the name was shortened to The Undertaker and he has remained with the company since. Nicknamed "The Deadman", he is portrayed as an undead and macabre entity who uses scare tactics. The Undertaker has also used the alternate identity of a biker dubbed the "American Bad-Ass", which he portrayed from May 2000 to November 2003. His half-brother, Kane, is also a character within WWE; the pair have both feuded, and allied as a tag team called the Brothers of Destruction.</p>
<p>The Undertaker holds an unrivaled record at WrestleMania, WWE's premier annual pay-per-view event, with a 21–0 undefeated streak (with no appearances at WrestleMania X and 2000) before being beaten by Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania XXX. Another similar achievement was from December 1991 to September 1993, when he did not lose a single match, marking the longest undefeated streak in WWF in the 90s.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> Calaway is an eight-time World Champion having won the WWF/E Championship four times and the World Heavyweight Championship three times as The Undertaker, and the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship once under his Master of Pain character. The Undertaker is also a seven-time Tag Team champion: a six-time World Tag Team Champion and one-time WCW World Tag Team Champion. The Undertaker was the winner of the 2007 Royal Rumble and became the first man to enter the annual event last and win.</p>

Their main use was to charge the enemy, trampling them and breaking their ranks and instilling terror. An <b>elephantry</b> is a cavalry unit containing elephant-mounted troops. They were first employed in India, the practice spreading out across south-east Asia and westwards into the Mediterranean. Their most famous use in the West was by the Greek general Pyrrhus of Epirus and in significant numbers by the armies of Carthage, including briefly by Hannibal.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, improved tactics reduced the value of the elephant in battle, while their availability in the wild also decreased. In the east, where supplies of animals were greater and the terrain ideal, it was the advent of the cannon that finally concluded the use of the combat elephant at the end of the 19th century, thereafter restricting their use to engineering and labour roles.</p>
