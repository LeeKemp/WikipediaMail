		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 17 January 2014 </h1><h2> Space Ghost Coast to Coast</h2><p><i><b>Space Ghost Coast to Coast</b></i> (often abbreviated <i><b>SGC2C</b></i>) is an American animated parody talk show, hosted by the 1960s Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Space Ghost. The show premiered on April 15, 1994, on Cartoon Network. Though the original 1960s series aired as a standard Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning superhero cartoon, <i>Space Ghost Coast to Coast</i> was a total reboot of the series intended for adults, now reinterpreted as an absurdist parody talk show and produced using the original artwork (owned by Cartoon Network, and thus royalty free).</p>
<p>The series' focus on surrealism, non-sequiturs and random, unpredictable parody humor proved the perfect vehicle to launch the network's late night television block, Adult Swim, serving as the flagship show from 2001–2004. <i>Space Ghost Coast to Coast</i> was recommended to be the first fully produced series to air on Cartoon Network. SGC2C was also the first Cartoon Network original series to later air on Adult Swim and Gametap. The show was rated TV-Y7, TV-PG, and TV-14, making it the first and only Cartoon Network original show to receive these three TV ratings. The series has had a cult following from the moment the series began that has continued through today.</p>
