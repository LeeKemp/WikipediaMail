		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 18 December 2013 </h1><h2> Mega Millions</h2><p><b>Mega Millions</b> (initially called <i>The Big Game Mega Millions</i> as the successor of <i>The Big Game</i>) is an American multi-jurisdictional lottery game. The first <i>(The Big Game) Mega Millions</i> drawing was in 2002 (see below).</p>
<p>The minimum Mega Millions advertised jackpot is $15 million, paid in 30 graduated yearly installments, increasing 5% per annum (unless the cash option is chosen; see below for differences by state). The jackpot increases when there is no top-prize winner (see below for information on how the game's jackpot is funded).</p>
<p>Reflecting common practice among American lotteries, the jackpot is advertised as a nominal value of annual installments. A cash value option (the usual choice), when chosen by a jackpot winner, pays the approximate present value of the installments. As of October 18, 2013, Mega Millions uses a 5/75 (for the white balls) plus 1/15 (for the "Mega Ball") double matrix to select its winning numbers. Each game costs $1. Of the 45 Mega Millions jurisdictions, all but California offer an option, called <i>Megaplier</i> (such games are $2 each) where non-jackpot prizes are multiplied by 2, 3, 4, or 5. The <i>Megaplier</i> was made available to all Mega Millions jurisdictions in January 2011; it began as an option available only in Texas. Mega Millions is drawn at 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday and Friday evenings, including holidays. Mega Millions is administered by a consortium of its 12 original lotteries and the drawings are held at the studios of ABC affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, supervised by the Georgia Lottery.</p>
<p>In the December 17, 2013 drawing, the current 5/75 + 1/15 format produced its first jackpot winner with a $636 Million annuity value (with a cash option of $341 Million), which is the second highest jackpot in history. There were two jackpot-winning tickets; one each sold in San Jose, California and Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>The largest jackpot in Mega Millions, as well as in American lottery, history was $656 Million annuity value (with a cash option of $474 Million) for the March 30, 2012 drawing, in which there were three jackpot-winning tickets; one each in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. All three tickets had been claimed by April 18, with each set of winners choosing the cash option of $158 Million, a one-third share. The largest Mega Millions prize was $319 million (annuity) for the lone winning ticket of the March 25, 2011 drawing.</p>

Historically the name refers to the <b>Bavarian Illuminati</b>, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on May 1, 1776 to oppose superstition, prejudice, religious influence over public life, abuses of state power, and to support women's education and gender equality. The Illuminati — along with other secret societies — were outlawed by the Bavarian ruler, Charles Theodore, with the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church, and permanently disbanded in 1785. In the several years following, the group was vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed they had regrouped and were responsible for the French Revolution.</p>
<p>In subsequent use, "Illuminati" refers to various organizations claiming or purported to have unsubstantiated links to the original Bavarian Illuminati or similar secret societies, and often alleged to conspire to control world affairs by masterminding events and planting agents in government and corporations to establish a New World Order and gain further political power and influence. Central to some of the most widely known and elaborate conspiracy theories, the Illuminati have been depicted as lurking in the shadows and pulling the strings and levers of power in dozens of novels, movies, television shows, comics, video games and music videos.</p>

In 2001, he voluntarily returned to the United Kingdom and spent several years in prison, where his health rapidly declined. On 6 August 2009, Biggs was released from prison on compassionate grounds. He died in December 2013.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Biggs' >More...</a><hr><h2> Christmas</h2><p><b>Christmas</b> (Old English: <i>Crīstesmæsse</i>, meaning "Christ's Mass") is an annual commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ and a widely observed holiday, celebrated generally on December 25 by billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it closes the Advent season and initiates the twelve days of Christmastide, which ends after the twelfth night. Christmas is a civil holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated by an increasing number of non-Christians, and is an integral part of the Christmas and holiday season.</p>
<p>While the birth year of Jesus is estimated among modern historians to have been between 7 and 2 BC, the exact month and day of his birth are unknown. His birth is mentioned in two of the four canonical gospels. By the early-to-mid 4th century, the Western Christian Church had placed Christmas on December 25, a date later adopted in the East. The date of Christmas may have initially been chosen to correspond with the day exactly nine months after early Christians believed Jesus to have been conceived, or with one or more ancient polytheistic festivals that occurred near southern solstice (i.e., the Roman winter solstice); a further solar connection has been suggested because of a biblical verse identifying Jesus as the "Sun of righteousness".</p>
<p>The original date of the celebration in Eastern Christianity was January 6, in connection with Epiphany, and that is still the date of the celebration for the Armenian Apostolic Church and in Armenia, where it is a public holiday. As of 2013, there is a difference of 13 days between the modern Gregorian calendar and the older Julian calendar. Those who continue to use the Julian calendar or its equivalents thus celebrate December 25 and January 6, which on the Gregorian calendar translate as January 7 and January 19. For this reason, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eriteria, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Serbia, the Republic of Macedonia, and the Republic of Moldova celebrate Christmas on what in the Gregorian calendar is January 7. Eastern Orthodox Churches in Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Antioch, Alexandria, Albania, Finland, and the Orthodox Church in America celebrate Christmas on December 25 in the revised Julian calendar, corresponding to December 25 also in the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving, Christmas music and caroling, an exchange of Christmas cards, church celebrations, a special meal, and the display of various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity among both Christians and non-Christians, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. The economic impact of Christmas is a factor that has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.</p>

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas' >More...</a><hr><h2> Bitcoin</h2><p><b>Bitcoin</b> refers to the system of rules followed for creating, transferring and transacting a digital representation of a store of value. "A Bitcoin" refers to a single unit of that digital representation. The system of rules are called the Bitcoin protocol that are applied on a peer-to-peer network.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin protocol allows direct Bitcoin payments from person to person <b>without</b> the use of a trusted central financial institution. If a trusted intermediate is removed and direct person to person transactions are allowed, it introduces a problem called double spend, wherein a malicious person can claim to have more money than they really have. Bitcoin protocol solves the double spend problem by using an open ledger of all Bitcoin transactions and a method to prevent anyone from changing old entries in the ledger. The methods of achieving irreversible ledger using cryptography is described below.</p>
<p>To transact in Bitcoins, one has to download a software that follows the Bitcoin Protocol that uses a network to effect the digital transfers. This software is commonly called the Bitcoin wallet software. Alternatively, some websites offer a web based online wallet allowing one to conduct transactions without downloading a client. These websites essentially are connected via the same Bitcoin protocol. Since Bitcoin represents something of value it can be used as a digital currency.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by pseudonymous developer "Satoshi Nakamoto". Bitcoin has been called a cryptocurrency because it uses public-key cryptography for security. Users send payments by broadcasting digitally signed messages that transfer ownership of bitcoins, the unit of currency. A decentralized network of specialized computers verifies and timestamps all transactions using a proof-of-work system. The operators of these computers, known as "miners", are rewarded with transaction fees and newly minted bitcoins.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has been a subject of scrutiny for its use in illicit activities. In 2013 the FBI shut down the Silk Road online black market and seized US$28.5 million worth of bitcoin from the alleged mastermind. Theft of bitcoins has been covered extensively in the media. The risk of theft can be mitigated by generating and storing keys offline. It is now prohibited for Chinese financial banks to operate using bitcoins or for bitcoins to be used as legal tender currency.</p>
<p>Commercial use of Bitcoin, illicit or otherwise, is currently small compared to its use by speculators, which has fueled price volatility. However, Bitcoin is also used to pay for products and services. Merchants have an incentive to accept the currency because transaction fees are lower than the 2 to 3% typically imposed by credit card processors. Notable vendors include OkCupid, Reddit, WordPress, and Virgin Galactic.</p>

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.</p>
<p>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.</p>
<p>Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs (such as Py2exe, or Pyinstaller). Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.</p>
<p>CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.</p>
