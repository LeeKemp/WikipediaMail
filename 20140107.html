		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 07 January 2014 </h1><h2> List of Doctor Who serials</h2><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials' >More...</a><hr><h2> Zora Neale Hurston</h2><p><b>Zora Neale Hurston</b> (January 7, 1891 – January 28, 1960) was an American folklorist, anthropologist, and author. Of Hurston's four novels and more than 50 published short stories, plays, and essays, she is best known for her 1937 novel <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i>.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston' >More...</a><hr><h2> Polar vortex</h2><p>A <b>polar vortex</b> (also known as an <b>Arctic cyclone</b>, <b>sub-polar cyclone</b>, and a <b>circumpolar whirl</b>) is a persistent, large-scale cyclone located near either of a planet's geographical poles. On Earth, the polar vortices are located in the middle and upper troposphere and the stratosphere. They surround the polar highs and lie in the wake of the polar front. These cold-core low-pressure areas strengthen in the winter and weaken in the summer. They usually span 1,000–2,000 kilometers (620–1,240 miles) in which the air is circulating in a counter-clockwise fashion (in the northern hemisphere). As with other cyclones, their rotation is caused by the Coriolis effect.</p>
<p>The Arctic vortex in the Northern Hemisphere has two centres, one near Baffin Island and the other over northeast Siberia. In the southern hemisphere, it tends to be located near the edge of the Ross ice shelf near 160 west longitude. When the polar vortex is strong, the Westerlies increase in strength. When the polar cyclone is weak, the general flow pattern across mid-latitudes buckles and significant cold outbreaks occur. Ozone depletion occurs within the polar vortex, particularly over the Southern Hemisphere, which reaches a maximum in the spring.</p>

Fernández was looking for files on a former prisoner. Instead, he found archives describing the fates of thousands of Latin Americans who had been secretly kidnapped, tortured, and killed by the security services of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. This was known as Operation Condor.</p>
<p>The "terror archives" listed 50,000 people murdered, 30,000 people disappeared and 400,000 people imprisoned. They also revealed that other countries such as Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela cooperated, to various degrees, by providing intelligence information that had been requested by the security services of the Southern Cone countries. Some of these countries have used portions of the archives, now in Asunción's Palace of Justice, to prosecute former military officers. Much of the case built against General Pinochet by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón was made using those archives. Dr. Almada, himself a victim of Condor, was twice interviewed by Baltasar Garzón.</p>
<p>"[The documents] are a mountain of ignominy, of lies, which Stroessner [Paraguay's dictator until 1989] used for 40 years to blackmail the Paraguayan people," states Dr. Almada. He wants the UNESCO to list the "terror archives" as an international cultural site, as this would greatly facilitate access to funding to preserve and protect the documents.</p>
<p>In May 2000, a UNESCO mission visited Asunción following a request from the Paraguayan authorities for help in putting these files on the Memory of the World Register, one element of a program aimed at safeguarding and promoting the documentary heritage of humanity to ensure that records are preserved and available for consultation.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archives_of_Terror' >More...</a><hr><h2> Gary Dockery</h2><p><b>Gary French Dockery</b> (1954 – April 15, 1997), was a police officer in Walden, Tennessee, who made world headlines after emerging from a 7½ year coma-like state and started talking enthusiastically, recognizing friends and recalling events from past years. He then fell back into a coma and died a year later.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Dockery' >More...</a><hr><h2> Wallenberg family</h2><p>The <b>Wallenberg family</b> (known as <b>The Wallenbergs</b> or simply <b>Wallenbergs</b>) is a prominent Swedish banking family, renowned as bankers, industrialists, politicians, diplomats and philanthropists. The most famous of the Wallenbergs, Raoul Wallenberg, a diplomat, worked in Budapest, Hungary, during World War II to rescue Jews from the Holocaust. Between July and December 1944, he issued protective passports and housed Jews, saving tens of thousands of Jewish lives. The Wallenberg sphere, an international banking- and industry group under the control of Wallenberg family through the holding company Investor AB, based in Stockholm, Sweden, is today Europe's largest family-controlled business empire. In Sweden alone, the sphere was estimated to indirectly control about a third of the national GDP in 1990.</p>

The participants were the two highest-ranked teams in the BCS standings at the end of the regular college football season, determined by averaging the results of the final weekly <i>USA Today</i> Coaches' Poll, Harris Interactive Poll of media, former players and coaches, and the average of six participating computer rankings.</p>
<p>Since the formation of the Bowl Championship Series, there have been several controversies regarding the schools selected to participate in the BCS National Championship Game. Most notably, following the 2003 season, the BCS ranking system selected the #3 ranked school in the Associated Press writers' poll, the University of Oklahoma, over the #1 ranked school in that poll, the University of Southern California, to participate in the National Championship Game (the Nokia Sugar Bowl) despite Oklahoma's decisive loss to Kansas State in the 2003 Big 12 Championship Game. 2003 is the only season, to date, since the inception of the BCS in which the national championship has been split, with Louisiana State University winning the BCS national championship and the University of Southern California winning the AP national championship and the FWAA national championship.</p>
<p>The BCS National Championship for the 2013 season at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, CA was held on January 6, 2014, and televised on the ESPN television network. The Florida State Seminoles defeated the Auburn Tigers, 34–31.</p>
<p>A four team system, the College Football Playoff, will replace the BCS single-game championship format beginning with the 2014 season.</p>
