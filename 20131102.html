		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 02 November 2013 </h1><h2> List of diplomatic missions of the United States</h2><p>This is a <b>list of diplomatic missions of the United States</b>.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_the_United_States' >More...</a><hr><h2> Ultra Hand</h2><p>The <b>Ultra Hand</b> was a toy manufactured by Nintendo in the late 1960s. It was created in 1966 by employee Gunpei Yokoi.</p>
<p>The Ultra Hand consists of several criss-cross-connected plastic elements, and operates on the "lazy tongs" pantograph principle. One end of the Ultra Hand has scissor-like handles and is operated like scissors, extending when the handles are pinched together and retracting when they are parted. On the other end of the Ultra Hand are two bowl-shaped grips with which ball-like objects can be gripped when the Ultra Hand is fully extended. Three colored balls were included in the Ultra Hand package, along with stands on which the balls can rest.</p>
<p>Ultra Hand was a commercial success, selling over a million units. It was the first of several toys developed by Yokoi that helped to save the company from serious financial difficulties.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Hand' >More...</a><hr><h2> Rangoli</h2><p><b>Rangoli</b>, also known as <b>kolam</b> or muggu is a folk art from India. It is usually made during Diwali, Onam, Pongal and other Indian festivals. Typically consisting of bright colors, rangoli is a decorative design made in living rooms and courtyard floors during Hindu festivals . They are meant to be sacred welcoming areas for the Hindu deities. The ancient symbols have been passed down through the ages, from each generation to the next, keeping both the art form and the tradition alive. The patterns are typically created with materials including colored rice, dry flour, (colored) sand or even flower petals. Similar practices are followed in different Indian states: in Tamil Nadu, there is Kolam in Tamil Nadu; Mandana in Rajasthan; Chowkpurna in Northern India; Alpana in West Bengal; Aripana in Bihar; Chowk pujan in Uttar Pradesh; Muggu in Andhra Pradesh and others.</p>
<p>The purpose of rangoli is decoration, and it is thought to bring good luck. Design depictions may also vary as they reflect traditions, folklore and practices that are unique to each area. It is traditionally done by women. Generally, this practice is showcased during occasions such as festivals, auspicious observances, marriage celebrations and other similar milestones and gatherings.</p>
<p>Rangoli designs can be simple geometric shapes, deity impressions, or flower and petal shapes (appropriate for the given celebrations), but they can also be very elaborate designs crafted by numerous people. The base material is usually dry or wet granulated rice or dry flour, to which sindoor (vermilion), haldi (turmeric) and other natural colors can be added. Chemical colors are a modern variation. Other materials include colored sand and even flowers and petals, as in the case of flower rangolis.</p>

Unlike Test matches, ODIs consist of one innings per team, having a limit in the number of overs. The limit of overs is currently 50 overs per innings, although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs. ODI cricket is List-A cricket, so statistics and records set in ODI matches also count toward List-A records. The earliest match now recognised as an ODI was played between England and Australia in January 1971; since then there have been over 3,000 ODIs played by 25 teams. The frequency of matches has steadily increased, partly because of the increase in the number of ODI-playing countries, and partly as the cricket boards of those nations seek to maximise their revenue.</p>
<p>The most successful team in ODI cricket, in terms of win percentage, barring the Asia XI cricket team, is South Africa, having won 300 of their 483 ODIs (64.36%). In contrast, four teams have failed to win a single ODI: East Africa, Hong Kong, Namibia, and the USA. Notable ODI records include longest winning sequence (Australia, 21), longest losing sequence (Bangladesh, 23), highest individual score (Virender Sehwag, 219), best bowling figures (Chaminda Vaas, 8–19), most runs in an over (Herschelle Gibbs, 36) and fastest century (Shahid Afridi, 37 deliveries).</p>
<p>The trend of countries to increase the number of ODI matches they play means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern players. Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has scored the most runs in ODIs with a total of 18,426. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan is the highest ODI wicket-taker with a total of 534 wickets. The record for most dismissals by a wicket-keeper is held by Adam Gilchrist of Australia while the record for most catches by a fielder is held by Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardene.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_One_Day_International_cricket_records' >More...</a><hr><h2> November 1</h2><p><b>November 1</b> is the 305th day of the year (306th in leap years) in the Gregorian calendar.

Companies such as Google, Microsoft and Genpact have offices in the area.</p>

Directed and written by Gavin Hood, the film stars Asa Butterfield as Andrew "Ender" Wiggin, an unusually gifted child who is sent to an advanced military school in space to prepare for a future alien invasion. The cast also includes Hailee Steinfeld, Ben Kingsley, Viola Davis, Abigail Breslin, and Harrison Ford.</p>
<p>The film was first released in Germany October 24 followed by the United Kingdom and Ireland on October 25. It was released in the United States, Canada and India on November 1 and many other countries from October 30 throughout mid-January of 2014.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)' >More...</a><hr><h2> The Big Bang Theory</h2><p><i><b>The Big Bang Theory</b></i> is an American sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, both of whom serve as executive producers on the show along with Steven Molaro. All three also serve as head writers. It premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007. The seventh season premiered on September 26, 2013.</p>
<p>The show is centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.</p>
<p>Over time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle, a physicist colleague at Caltech and, at different times, a lover of both Leonard and Howard; Bernadette Rostenkowski, Howard's girlfriend (later his wife), a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler, who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon on a dating website (and later becomes Sheldon's girlfriend), and Stuart Bloom, the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit.</p>
<p>On January 12, 2011, CBS announced that the series had been renewed for an additional three years, extending it through the 2013–14 season.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-11-02 11:30:08 -0400 -->
