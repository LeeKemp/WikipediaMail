  title: Memorial Day
  extract: |
    <p><b>Memorial Day</b> is a US federal holiday wherein the men and women who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces are remembered. The holiday, which is celebrated every year on the final Monday of May, was formerly known as <b>Decoration Day</b> and originated after the American Civil War to commemorate the Union and Confederate soldiers who died in the Civil War. By the 20th century, Memorial Day had been extended to honor all Americans who have died while in the military service. It typically marks the start of the summer vacation season, while Labor Day marks its end.</p>
    <p>Many people visit cemeteries and memorials, particularly to honor those who have died in military service. Many volunteers place an American flag on each grave in national cemeteries.</p>
    <p>Annual Decoration Days for particular cemeteries are held on a Sunday in late spring or early summer in some rural areas of the American South, notably in the mountains. In cases involving a family graveyard where remote ancestors as well as those who were deceased more recently are buried, this may take on the character of an extended family reunion to which some people travel hundreds of miles. People gather on the designated day and put flowers on graves and renew contacts with kinfolk and others. There often is a religious service and a "dinner on the ground," the traditional term for a potluck meal in which people used to spread the dishes out on sheets or tablecloths on the grass. It is believed that this practice began before the American Civil War and thus may reflect the real origin of the "memorial day" idea.</p>
    <p>Memorial Day is not to be confused with Veterans Day; Memorial Day is a day of remembering the men and women who died while serving, while Veterans Day celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans.</p>

    <p><b>Ronald McDonald</b> is a clown character used as the primary mascot of the McDonald's fast-food restaurant chain. In television commercials, the clown inhabits a fantasy world called McDonaldland, and has adventures with his friends Mayor McCheese, the Hamburglar, Grimace, Birdie the Early Bird, and The Fry Kids.

    <p>The <i><b>X-Men</b></i> film series consists of superhero films based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. 20th Century Fox obtained the film rights to the characters in 1994, and after numerous drafts, Bryan Singer was hired to direct <i>X-Men</i> (2000) and its sequel, <i>X2</i> (2003). Singer left the potential third and fourth films, leaving Brett Ratner to direct <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> (2006). <i>X-Men</i> and <i>X2</i> were met with positive reviews for their dark, realistic tone and subtexts dealing with discrimination and intolerance, while <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> was met with mixed reviews.</p>
    <p>After each film earned higher box-office grosses than its predecessor, three spin-off films were released. <i>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</i> (2009), directed by Gavin Hood, focuses on Wolverine's origin story. <i>X-Men: First Class</i> (2011), directed by Matthew Vaughn, focuses on the origins of Professor X and Magneto. <i>The Wolverine</i> (2013), directed by James Mangold, focuses on Wolverine after the events of <i>The Last Stand</i>. <i>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</i> was met with negative reviews from critics, while <i>X-Men: First Class</i> and <i>The Wolverine</i> were received more positively.</p>
    <p>The seventh film, <i>X-Men: Days of Future Past</i> (2014) featured the return of the original trilogy cast and Singer as the director. Serving as a dual sequel to both <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> and <i>X-Men: First Class</i>, it was met with critical acclaim, with some praising it as the best film in the series.</p>
    <p>With seven films released, the <i>X-Men</i> film series is the 15th highest-grossing film franchise, having grossed over $2 billion worldwide. It is set to continue with <i>X-Men: Apocalypse</i> (2016), a sequel to <i>Days of Future Past</i> and a third <i>Wolverine</i> film (2017).</p>

  title: Iggy Azalea
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Amethyst Amelia Kelly</b> (born 7 June 1990), better known by her stage name <b>Iggy Azalea</b> (/əˈzeɪljə/), is an Australian recording artist and model from Mullumbimby, New South Wales. She relocated to the United States at the age of 16, first staying in Miami, Florida, and then other parts of the South, including Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. She first gained recognition after the respective music videos for her controversial songs "Pussy" and "Two Times" went viral on YouTube. On 27 September 2011, Azalea released her first full-length project, a mixtape entitled <i>Ignorant Art</i>, saying she made it "with the intent to make people question and redefine old ideals." In 2012, she announced her signing to Mercury Records and the following year to Island Def Jam. Azalea went into professional modeling, when she became represented by Wilhelmina Models, in the spring of 2012; later that year she was announced the "New Face of Levi Jeans".</p>
    <p>In 2012, Azalea became the first female and non-American rapper to be featured on <i>XXL</i> magazine's annual Top 10 Freshman cover issue. On 30 July 2012, she released <i>Glory</i>, her debut extended play (EP), which was executive produced by American rapper and Grand Hustle label-boss T.I.. The EP was composed of songs originally meant to appear on Azalea's long-awaited and often-delayed debut album. On 11 October 2012, she released her second mixtape <i>TrapGold</i>, which was produced entirely by high-profile producer Diplo, as well as 1st Down of production team FKi. The mixtape is significant for foreshadowing Azalea's new approach to music and her later work, which heavily includes electronic elements. <sup style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>check quotation syntax</i>]</sup> Azalea's debut studio album <i>The New Classic</i> was released on 21 April 2014. Initially set to be released with Grand Hustle and Interscope Records, after label conflicts, in 2013 Azalea finally secured a deal with Mercury Records and later Island Def Jam, to release her debut album. The album was preceded by the lead single and Azalea's commercial debut single "Work", which successfully charted on several international music charts and peaked at No. 17 on the UK Singles Chart. The other three singles released in promotion for the album were "Bounce", "Change Your Life" and "Fancy", with the latter two featuring guest appearances from T.I. and Charli XCX, respectively.</p>

    <p>The <b>2014 FIFA World Cup</b> will be the 20th FIFA World Cup, an international men's football tournament that is scheduled to take place in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July 2014. It will be the second time that Brazil has hosted the competition, the previous being in 1950. Brazil was elected unchallenged as host nation in 2007 after the international football federation, FIFA, decreed that the tournament would be staged in South America for the first time since 1978 in Argentina, and the fifth time overall.</p>
    <p>The national teams of 31 countries advanced through qualification competitions that began in June 2011 to participate with the host nation Brazil in the final tournament. A total of 64 matches are to be played in twelve cities across Brazil in either new or redeveloped stadiums, with the tournament beginning with a group stage. For the first time at a World Cup Finals, the matches will use goal-line technology.</p>
    <p>With the host country, all world champion teams since the first World Cup in 1930 (Uruguay, Italy, Germany, England, Argentina, France and Spain) have qualified for this competition. Spain is the defending champion, having defeated the Netherlands 1–0 in the 2010 World Cup final to win its first World title. The previous four World Cups staged in South America were all won by South American teams.</p>
