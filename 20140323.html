It was originally developed by British scientists and then brought to market by the US-based pharmaceutical company Pfizer. It acts by inhibiting cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), an enzyme that promotes degradation of cGMP, which regulates blood flow in the penis. Since becoming available in 1998, sildenafil has been the prime treatment for erectile dysfunction; its primary competitors on the market are tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).</p>

<p>After being signed by director Howard Hughes, Harlow's first major appearance was in <i>Hell's Angels</i> (1930), followed by a series of critically unsuccessful films, before signing with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1932. Harlow became a leading lady for MGM, starring in a string of hit films including <i>Red Dust</i> (1932), <i>Dinner at Eight</i> (1933), <i>Reckless</i> (1935) and <i>Suzy</i> (1936). Among her frequent co-stars were William Powell, Spencer Tracy and, in six films, Clark Gable.</p>
<p>Harlow's popularity rivaled and soon surpassed that of her MGM colleagues Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer. She had become one of the biggest movie stars in the world by the late 1930s, often nicknamed the "Blonde Bombshell" and the "Platinum Blonde", and popular for her "Laughing Vamp" movie persona.</p>
<p>She died of renal failure during the filming of <i>Saratoga</i> in 1937 at the age of 26. The film was completed using doubles and released a little over a month after Harlow's death. The American Film Institute ranked her as the 22nd greatest female movie star.</p>

She was named <i>Penthouse</i> Pet of the Year in 2003 and was a contract star for Vivid Entertainment. Named by <i>Maxim</i> as one of the 12 top porn stars in 2010, she has also played roles in independent mainstream films and television shows. She later made her Bollywood debut in Pooja Bhatt's erotic thriller <i>Jism 2</i> (2012) and now works in Hindi films.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Leone' >More...</a><hr><h2> Automobile</h2><p>An <b>automobile</b>, <b>autocar</b>, <b>motor car</b> or <b>car</b> is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transporting passengers, which also carries its own engine or motor. Most definitions of the term specify that automobiles are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods.</p>
<p>The year 1886 is regarded the year of birth of the modern automobile - with the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, by German inventor Karl Benz. Motorized wagons soon replaced animal-drafted carriages, especially after automobiles became affordable for many people when the Ford Model T was introduced in 1908.</p>
<p>The term <i>motorcar</i> has formerly also been used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage. These locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems.</p>
<p>It was estimated in 2010 that the number of automobiles had risen to over 1 billion vehicles, up from the 500 million of 1986. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other NICs.</p>
