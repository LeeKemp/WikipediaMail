		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 26 January 2014 </h1><h2> Viewtiful Joe</h2><p><i><b>Viewtiful Joe</b></i> (ビューティフル ジョー, <i>Byūtifuru Jō</i><sup>?</sup>) is a side scrolling beat 'em up video game developed by Team Viewtiful for the GameCube. It was originally released in 2003 as a part of the Capcom Five under director Hideki Kamiya and producer Atsushi Inaba. The game was later ported to the PlayStation 2 by the same design team under the name Clover Studio, subtitled <i>Aratanaru Kibō</i> (新たなる希望<sup>?</sup>, lit. "A New Hope") in Japan. The game's story concerns Joe, an avid movie-goer whose girlfriend Silvia is kidnapped during a film starring Joe's favorite superhero, Captain Blue. Joe is shortly thereafter thrust into Movieland, where Silvia is taken by the villainous group known as Jadow. After accepting a special V-Watch from Captain Blue, Joe transforms into the tokusatsu-style persona "Viewtiful Joe" and sets out to rescue her.</p>
<p>The gameplay of <i>Viewtiful Joe</i> features traditional 2D platform side-scrolling intermixed with 3D cel-shaded graphics. Abilities known as "VFX Powers" grant the player special actions for combat and puzzle-solving, such as slowing down or speeding up time. <i>Viewtiful Joe</i> was critically acclaimed for its unique visual style and gameplay, earning itself a number of awards from various media publications. A minor commercial success, the game spawned a few sequels with releases seen on other consoles such as the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and Nintendo DS. An anime adaption of the game was also produced.</p>

The case was a <i>cause célèbre</i> throughout the United States. Following her release from the prison in which she had been held during the trial, Borden chose to remain a resident of Fall River, Massachusetts, for the rest of her life, despite facing significant ostracism. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts elected to charge no one else with the murder of Andrew and Abby Borden; speculation about the crimes continues into the 21st century.</p>

Although originally introduced in the early 1980s, the idea was not substantially researched until decades later. In 2007, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation requested Intellectual Ventures LLC to find a way to fight and eventually end malaria. Intellectual Ventures resurrected the idea of using lasers to kill mosquitoes and now has a working prototype. The idea has been criticized because most areas where malaria runs rampant do not have reliable electrical power.</p>

<p>The Constitution was passed by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 but was adopted on 26 January 1950 with a democratic government system, completing the country's transition toward becoming an independent republic. 26 January was selected for this purpose because it was this day in 1930 when the Declaration of Indian Independence (Purna Swaraj) was proclaimed by the Indian National Congress.</p>
<p>It is one of three national holidays in India, other two being Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti.</p>

His career-high singles ranking is world No. 3, which he will officially attain on 27 January 2014 as a result of winning his first Grand Slam event, the 2014 Australian Open. He considers clay his best surface and his serve and volley his best shot. He won a gold medal for Switzerland in the men's doubles event at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, partnering Roger Federer, by beating Swedish team Simon Aspelin and Thomas Johansson in the final. They were also honoured with the 2008 Swiss Team of the Year Award. He also made the semifinals of the 2013 US Open where he lost to Novak Djokovic in five sets.

<p>John McEnroe believes that Wawrinka has one of the most powerful backhands he has ever seen and describes him as having "the best one-handed backhand in the game today".</p>
