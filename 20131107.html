Credited to Pythagoras of Samos, it allows the user to fill the cup with wine up to a certain level. If the user fills the cup only to that level, the imbiber may enjoy a drink in peace. If the imbiber exhibits gluttony, however, the cup spills its entire contents out the bottom (onto the lap of the immodest drinker). </p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_cup' >More...</a><hr><h2> EinStein würfelt nicht</h2><ol><li>REDIRECT EinStein würfelt nicht!  </li>

<p>The film follows high school senior Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), who decides to skip school and spend the day in downtown Chicago. Accompanied by his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) and his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), he creatively avoids his school's Dean of Students Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), his resentful sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), and his parents. During the film, Bueller frequently breaks the fourth wall by speaking directly to the camera to explain to the audience his thoughts and techniques.</p>
<p>Hughes wrote the screenplay in less than a week and shot the film—on a budget of $5.8 million—over several months in late 1985. Featuring many famous Chicago landmarks including the then Sears Tower and the Art Institute of Chicago, the film was Hughes' love letter to the city: "I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could. Not just in the architecture and landscape, but the spirit."</p>
<p>Released by Paramount Pictures on June 11, 1986, <i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</i> became one of the top-grossing films of the year and was enthusiastically received by critics and audiences alike.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Bueller%27s_Day_Off' >More...</a><hr><h2> Luke Bryan</h2><p><b>Thomas Luther "Luke" Bryan</b> (born July 17, 1976) is an American Country singer. Bryan began his musical career in the mid-2000s, writing songs for Travis Tritt and Billy Currington. After signing with Capitol Records Nashville in 2007, he released the album <i>I'll Stay Me</i>, which included the singles "All My Friends Say", "We Rode in Trucks" and "Country Man". Follow-up album <i>Doin' My Thing</i> included "Do I", which Bryan co-wrote with Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood of Lady Antebellum, and the number one singles "Rain Is a Good Thing" and "Someone Else Calling You Baby". <i>Tailgates &amp; Tanlines</i>, released in 2011, includes "Country Girl (Shake It for Me)", and the number one singles "I Don't Want This Night to End", "Drunk on You", and "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye". Bryan's fourth album, <i>Crash My Party</i>, was released in August 2013 and includes the number one singles "Crash My Party" and "That's My Kind of Night". Bryan co-wrote all of his singles with the exception of "Drunk on You", "Crash My Party" and "That's My Kind of Night" and co-produced all four albums and one compilation album with Jeff Stevens. Bryan was the recipient of the Academy of Country Music Awards' Entertainer of the Year award.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Bryan' >More...</a><hr><h2> Neurofibromatosis</h2><p><b>Neurofibromatosis</b> (commonly abbreviated <b>NF</b>) refers to a number of inherited conditions that are clinically and genetically distinct and carry a high risk of tumor formation, particularly in the brain. Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means only one copy of the affected gene is needed for the disorder to develop. Therefore, if only one parent has neurofibromatosis, his or her children have a 50% chance of developing the condition as well (it is rarely the case that one person has the mutated gene twice, which would imply a 100% chance of his/her children developing NF). The severity in affected individuals can vary; this may be due to variable expressivity. Approximately half of cases are due to <i>de novo</i> mutations and no other affected family members are seen. It affects males and females equally. Additional, some individuals may have <i>mosaic</i> NF, in which some but not all cells of the body carry the mutation. The neurofibromatoses are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Neurofibromatosis type I, in which the nerve tissue grows tumors (neurofibromas) that may be benign and may cause serious damage by compressing nerves and other tissues.</li>
<li>Neurofibromatosis type II, in which bilateral acoustic neuromas (tumors of the vestibulocochlear nerve or cranial nerve 8 (CN VIII) also known as schwannoma) develop, often leading to hearing loss.</li>
<li>Schwannomatosis, in which painful schwannomas develop on cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves.</li>
</ul><p>Conditions which may be confused with NF-1 but which are not considered NF include:</p>
<ul><li>LEOPARD syndrome</li>
<li>Legius syndrome</li>
<li>Proteus Syndrome</li>
</ul><p>The Neurofibromatoses are considered as RASopathies and as members of the <i>neurocutaneous syndromes</i> (<i>phakomatoses</i>). In addition to the types of neurofibromatosis, the phakomatoses also include tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome and von Hippel-Lindau disease. This grouping is an artifact of an earlier time in medicine, before the distinct genetic basis of each of these diseases was understood.</p>

Yasgur</b> (December 15, 1919 – February 9, 1973) was an American farmer, best known as the owner of the dairy farm in Bethel, New York at which the Woodstock Music and Art Fair was held between August 15 and August 18, 1969.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Yasgur' >More...</a><hr><h2> Mary in Islam</h2><p>Mary (مريم <i>Marīam</i> in Arabic), the mother of Jesus (Isa), is considered one of the most righteous women in the Islamic tradition. She is mentioned more in the Quran than in the entire New Testament and is also the only woman mentioned by name in the Quran. According to the Quran, Isa was born miraculously by the will of God without a father. His mother is regarded as a chaste and virtuous woman and is said to have been a virgin. The Quran states clearly that Isa was the result of a virgin birth, but that neither Mary nor her son were divine. In the Quran, no other woman is given more attention than Mary and the Quran states that Mary was chosen above all women:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Behold! the angels said: "O Mary! Allah hath chosen thee and purified thee- chosen thee above the women of all nations.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The nineteenth chapter of the Quran is named after her and is, to some extent, about her life. Of the Quran's 114 suras, she is among only eight people who have a chapter named after them. Mary is specifically mentioned in the Quran, alongside Asiya, as an exemplar for all righteous women. Mary plays an important role in Islamic culture and religious tradition, and verses from the Quran relating to Mary are frequently inscribed on the <i>mihrab</i> of various mosques, including in the Hagia Sophia.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_in_Islam' >More...</a><hr><h2> Alkyne</h2><p>In organic chemistry, an <b>alkyne</b> is an unsaturated hydrocarbon which has at least one carbon—carbon triple bond between two carbon atoms. The simplest acyclic alkynes with only one triple bond and no other functional groups form a homologous series with the general chemical formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-2</sub>. Alkynes are traditionally known as acetylenes, although the name <i>acetylene</i> also refers specifically to C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, known formally as ethyne using IUPAC nomenclature. Like other hydrocarbons, alkynes are generally hydrophobic but tend to be more reactive.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkyne' >More...</a><hr><h2> George Strait</h2><p><b>George Harvey Strait</b> (born May 18, 1952), is an American country music singer, actor, and music producer known as the "King of Country" and called a living legend by some critics. He is known for his neotraditionalist country style.</p>
<p>Strait's success began when his first single "Unwound" was a hit in 1981. During the 1980s, seven of his albums reached number one on the country charts. In the 2000s, Strait was named Artist of the Decade by the Academy of Country Music, was elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and won his first Grammy award for the album <i>Troubadour</i>. Strait was named CMA Entertainer of the Year in 1989, 1990 and 2013, and ACM Entertainer of the Year in 1990. He has been nominated for more CMA and ACM awards and has more wins in both categories than any other artist. In 2009, he broke Conway Twitty's previous record for the most number-one hits on <i>Billboard'</i>s Hot Country Songs chart when his 44 number one singles surpassed Twitty's 40. Counting all music charts, Strait has amassed a total of 60 number-one hits, breaking a record also previously set by Twitty.</p>
<p>Strait has sold more than 70 million albums in the United States and his certifications from the RIAA include 13 multi-platinum, 33 platinum, and 38 gold albums. His best-selling album is <i>Pure Country</i> (1992), which sold 6 million (6× platinum). His highest certified album is <i>Strait Out of the Box</i> (1995), which sold 2 million copies (8× Platinum due to being a box set with four CDs). According to the RIAA, Strait is the 12th best-selling album recording artist in the United States overall. Strait's singing and acting career has earned him a net worth of $300 million so far.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Strait' >More...</a><hr><h2> X-ray</h2><p><b>X-radiation</b> (composed of <b>X-rays</b>) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10<sup>16</sup> Hz to 3×10<sup>19</sup> Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. However, much higher-energy X-rays can be generated for medical and industrial uses, for example radiotherapy, which utilizes linear accelerators to generate X-rays in the ranges of 6-20 MeV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning <b>Röntgen radiation</b>, after Wilhelm Röntgen, who is usually credited as its discoverer, and who had named it <i>X-radiation</i> to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of <i>X-ray(s)</i> in the English language includes the variants <i>x-ray(s)</i> and <i>X ray(s)</i>.</p>
<p>X-rays with photon energies above 5-10 keV (below 0.2-0.1 nm wavelength) are called <i>hard X-rays</i>, while those with lower energy are called <i>soft X-rays</i>. Due to their penetrating ability hard X-rays are widely used to image the inside of objects, e.g. in medical radiography and airport security. As a result, the term <i>X-ray</i> is metonymically used to refer to a radiographic image produced using this method, in addition to the method itself. Since the wavelengths of hard X-rays are similar to the size of atoms they are also useful for determining crystal structures by X-ray crystallography. By contrast, soft X-rays are easily absorbed in air and the attenuation length of 600 eV (~2 nm) X-rays in water is less than 1 micrometer.</p>
<p>The distinction between X-rays and gamma rays is not universal, however it is common practice to see the two types of radiation separated by their origin: X-rays are emitted by electrons, while gamma rays are emitted by the atomic nucleus. An alternative method for distinguishing between X- and gamma radiation is on the basis of wavelength, with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10<sup>−11</sup> m, defined as gamma rays. These definitions usually coincide since the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes generally has a longer wavelength and lower photon energy than the radiation emitted by radioactive nuclei.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray' >More...</a><hr><h2> Yasser Arafat</h2><p><b>Mohammed Yasser Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa</b> (Arabic: محمد ياسر عبد الرحمن عبد الرؤوف عرفات ‎‎; 24 August 1929 – 11 November 2004), popularly known as <b>Yasser Arafat</b> (Arabic: ياسر عرفات‎ , <i>Yāsir `Arafāt</i>) or by his kunya <b>Abu Ammar</b> (Arabic: أبو عمار‎ , <i>'Abū `Ammār</i>), was a Palestinian leader. He was Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), and leader of the Fatah political party and former paramilitary group, which he founded in 1959. Arafat spent much of his life fighting against Israel in the name of Palestinian self-determination. Originally opposed to Israel's existence, he modified his position in 1988 when he accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242. Arafat and his movement operated from several Arab countries. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Fatah faced off with Jordan in a brief civil war. Forced out of Jordan and into Lebanon, Arafat and Fatah were major targets of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions of that country.</p>
<p>Arafat remains a highly controversial figure whose legacy has been widely disputed. He was "revered by many Arabs," and most Palestinians, regardless of political ideology or faction, viewing him as a freedom fighter who symbolized their national aspirations. However, he was also reviled, especially by many Israelis, who viewed him as a terrorist responsible for hundreds of bombings and deaths. Critics have accused Arafat of mass corruption, secretly amassing a personal wealth estimated to be USD $1.3 billion by 2002 despite the degrading economic conditions of the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Later in his career, Arafat engaged in a series of negotiations with the government of Israel to end the decades-long conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. His political rivals, including Islamists and several PLO leftists, often denounced him for being corrupt or too submissive in his concessions to the Israeli government. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. During this time, Hamas and other militant organizations rose to power and shook the foundations of the authority that Fatah under Arafat had established in the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat became ill, fell into a coma and died on 11 November 2004 at the age of 75. The cause of his illness and subsequent death is disputed.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat' >More...</a><hr><h2> Google</h2><p><b>Google Inc.</b> is an American multinational corporation specializing in Internet-related services and products. These include search, cloud computing, software, and online advertising technologies. Most of its profits are derived from AdWords.</p>
<p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University. Together they own about 16 percent of its shares. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. Its mission statement from the outset was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful", and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil". In 2006 Google moved to headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.</p>

<p>Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine. It offers online productivity software including email (Gmail), an office suite (Google Drive), and social networking (Google+). Desktop products include applications for web browsing, organizing and editing photos, and instant messaging. The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system and the browser-only Chrome OS for a netbook known as a Chromebook. Google has moved increasingly into communications hardware: it partners with major electronics manufacturers in production of its high-end Nexus devices and acquired Motorola Mobility in May 2012. In 2012, a fiber-optic infrastructure was installed in Kansas City to facilitate a Google Fiber broadband service.</p>
<p>The corporation has been estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers around the world and to process over one billion search requests and about 24 petabytes of user-generated data each day. In December 2012 Alexa listed google.com as the most visited website in the world. Numerous Google sites in other languages figure in the top one hundred, as do several other Google-owned sites such as YouTube and Blogger. Its market dominance has led to criticism of the company over issues such as copyright, censorship, and privacy.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google' >More...</a><hr><h2> Go (game)</h2><p><b>Go</b> (Chinese: 圍棋 <i>wéiqí</i>, Japanese: 囲碁 <i>igo</i>, Korean: 바둑 <i>baduk</i>, Vietnamese: <i>碁圍</i> <i>cờ vây</i>, common meaning: "encircling game") is a board game for two players that originated in China more than 2,500 years ago. The game is noted for being rich in strategy despite its relatively simple rules.</p>
<p>The two players alternately place black and white playing pieces, called "stones", on the vacant intersections (called "points") of a grid of 19×19 lines (beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards). The object of the game is to use one's stones to surround a larger total area of the board than the opponent. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if captured; this is done by surrounding an opposing stone or group of stones by occupying all orthogonally-adjacent points. Players continue in this fashion until neither player wishes to make another move; the game has no set ending conditions. When a game concludes, the controlled points (territory) are counted along with captured stones to determine who has more points. Games may also be won by resignation.</p>
<p>Go originated in ancient China. Archaeological evidence shows that the early game was played on a board with a 17×17 grid, but by the time the game had spread to Korea and Japan, in about the 5th and 7th centuries AD respectively, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard.</p>
<p>As of mid-2008 there were well over 40 million Go players worldwide, the overwhelming majority living in East Asia. As of May 2012<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup>, the International Go Federation has a total of 74 member countries and four Association Members covering multiple countries.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-11-07 11:30:08 -0500 -->
