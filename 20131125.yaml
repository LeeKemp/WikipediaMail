  title: Climatic Research Unit email controversy
  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>Climatic Research Unit email controversy</b> (also known as <b>"Climategate"</b>) began in November 2009 with the hacking of a server at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) by an external attacker. Several weeks before the Copenhagen Summit on climate change, an unknown individual or group breached CRU's server and copied thousands of emails and computer files to various locations on the Internet.</p>
    <p>The story was first broken by climate change critics on their blogs, with columnist James Delingpole popularising the term "Climategate" to describe the controversy. Climate change critics and others denying the significance of human caused climate change argued that the emails showed that global warming was a scientific conspiracy, in which they alleged that scientists manipulated climate data and attempted to suppress critics. The accusations were rejected by the CRU, who said that the emails had been taken out of context and merely reflected an honest exchange of ideas.</p>
    <p>The mainstream media picked up the story as negotiations over climate change mitigation began in Copenhagen on 7 December. Because of the timing, scientists, policy makers, and public relations experts said that the release of emails was a smear campaign intended to undermine the climate conference. In response to the controversy, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released statements supporting the scientific consensus that the Earth's mean surface temperature had been rising for decades, with the AAAS concluding "based on multiple lines of scientific evidence that global climate change caused by human activities is now underway...it is a growing threat to society."</p>
    <p>Eight committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. However, the reports called on the scientists to avoid any such allegations in the future by taking steps to regain public confidence in their work, for example by opening up access to their supporting data, processing methods and software, and by promptly honouring freedom of information requests. The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged throughout the investigations.</p>

  title: Doctor Who
  extract: |-
    <p><i><b>Doctor Who</b></i> is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC. The programme depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lord—a time-travelling humanoid alien. He explores the universe in his TARDIS (<b>T</b>ime <b>A</b>nd <b>R</b>elative <b>D</b>imension <b>I</b>n <b>S</b>pace), a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.</p>
    <p>The show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies's tenure as executive producer. In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor. In 2013, the Peabody Awards honoured <i>Doctor Who</i> with an Institutional Peabody "for evolving with technology and the times like nothing else in the known television universe." The programme is listed in <i>Guinness World Records</i> as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world, the "most successful" science fiction series of all time—based on its over-all broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales, and iTunes traffic— and largest ever simulcast of a TV drama with "The Day of the Doctor." During its original run, it was recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget special effects, and pioneering use of electronic music (originally produced by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop).</p>
    <p>The show is a significant part of British popular culture, and elsewhere it has become a cult television favourite. The show has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. After an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot in the form of a television film, the programme was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T. Davies who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff. Series 1 in the 21st century, featuring Christopher Eccleston as the ninth incarnation, was produced by the BBC. Series 2 and 3 had some development money contributed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), which was credited as a co-producer. <i>Doctor Who</i> also spawned spin-offs in multiple media, including <i>Torchwood</i> (2006–11) and <i>The Sarah Jane Adventures</i> (2007–11), both created by Russell T Davies; <i>K-9</i> (2009–10), the four-part video series <i>P.R.O.B.E.</i> (1994–96), and a single pilot episode of <i>K-9 and Company</i> (1981). There also have been many spoofs and cultural references of the character in other media.</p>
    <p>Eleven actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show as regeneration, a life process of Time Lords through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality, which occurs after sustaining injury which would be fatal to most other species. Although each portrayal of the Doctor is different, and on occasions the various incarnations have even met one another, they are all meant to be aspects of the same character. The Doctor as of 2013 is portrayed by Matt Smith, who took up the role after David Tennant's last appearance. On 1 June 2013, it was announced that Matt Smith would leave the series and the eleventh Doctor would regenerate in the 2013 Christmas special. On 4 August 2013, Peter Capaldi was announced as the twelfth incarnation of the Doctor.</p>

    <p><b>Java</b> (Indonesian: <i><b>Jawa</b></i>) is an island of Indonesia. With a population of 135 million (excluding the 3.6 million on the island of Madura which is administered as part of the provinces of Java), Java is the world's most populous island, and one of the most densely populated places in the world. Java is the home of 60 percent of the Indonesian population. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 40s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.</p>
    <p>Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions, Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in Indonesia. A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east-west spine along the island. It has three main languages, though Javanese is dominant, and it is the native language of about 60 million people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java. Most of its residents are bilingual, with Indonesian as their first or second languages. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java has a diverse mixture of religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.</p>
    <p>Java is divided into four provinces, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Banten, and also two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.</p>

  title: Noida double murder case
  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>Noida double murder case</b> refers to the murder of 14-year old Aarushi Talwar and 45-year old Hemraj Banjade, a domestic help employed by her family, in Noida, India. The two were killed on the night of 15–16 May 2008 at Aarushi's home. The case aroused public interest as a whodunit story. It received heavy media coverage in India, and was also covered by the foreign media. The sensational nature of the media coverage, which included salacious allegations against Aarushi and the suspects, was criticized by many as a trial by media.</p>
    <p>When Aarushi's body was discovered on 16 May, the missing live-in servant Hemraj was considered as the main suspect. However, the next day, his dead body was discovered on the terrace. The police was heavily criticized for botching up the investigation by failing to secure the crime scene and not following important leads immediately.</p>
    <p>Initially, the Talwars' former servant Vishnu Sharma was considered as a suspect, as he had lost his job to Hemraj. However, soon, Aarushi's parents (Dr. Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar) became the main suspects. The police believed that Aarushi's father Rajesh had murdered the two after learning about a sexual relationship between them, or that Rajesh had hit Aarushi fatally after she confronted him about his alleged extra-marital affair (while Hemraj was killed as he was a witness to Aarushi's death). An alternative theory stated that Hemraj was the main target of the killing as he was blackmailing Rajesh, while Aarushi was killed for being a witness. The accusations enraged the friends and family members of the Talwars, who alleged that the police was trying to frame the parents in a bid to cover up its own incompetence and botched-up investigation. On 31 May, the case was transferred from the Uttar Pradesh Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Rajesh was released in June 2008, after the investigators could not find any solid evidence against him.</p>
    <p>By this time, the CBI's suspicion had moved to Hemraj's Nepali acquaintances: Krishna (an assistant at the Talwars' clinic), Rajkumar and Vijay (domestic servants). According to the CBI, the three men were let in the house by Hemraj. Krishna, who worked as an assistant at the Talwars' clinic, held a grudge against Rajesh, who had reprimanded him for an occupational mistake. The investigators suspected that the three men tried to sexually assault Aarushi and killed her when she resisted; Hemraj was killed as he was the only witness to their entry in the house. The CBI claimed that the three men had confessed to the crime in narco tests after being injected with sodium pentothal. However, there were accusations that the three men had been drilled with misinformation prior to their tests, and their lawyer later approached the NHRC with video recordings of the tests that allegedly showed the CBI "putting words in their mouths" and torturing them to confess the crimes. Their supporters claimed that the investigators were trying to frame the poor Nepalis in order to protect the upper-class Talwars. Ultimately, all the suspects were released due to the lack of any hard evidence: all of them had alibis and their DNA or fingerprints were not found at the crime scene.</p>
    <p>Unable to achieve any further breakthrough, in 2009, CBI handed over the investigation to a new team. After a second investigation, this new team argued that the case should be closed, citing "critical and substantial gaps" in the circumstantial evidence collected and an "absence of a clear-cut motive and incomplete understanding of the sequence of events." It named Rajesh Talwar as the only possible suspect, but stated that there was not enough evidence to charge him. The parents opposed the closure, criticizing the report's conclusion as baseless. The court noted that there was enough evidence to charge the parents, and ordered proceedings against them. The Talwars pleaded guilty, as they had done before. A special CBI court on 25th November 2013 held dentist couple Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar guilty of the murder of their daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj Banjade. The sentencing will be done on 26th November 2013.</p>

    <p><b>Facebook</b> is an online social networking service. Its name comes from the colloquial name for the book given to students at the start of the academic year by some American university administrations to help students get to know one another. Facebook was founded in February 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The founders had initially limited the website's membership to students of the University of Harvard, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities before it opened to high-school students, and eventually to anyone aged 13 and over. Facebook now allows anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old to become a registered user of the website.</p>
    <p>Users must register before using the site, after which they may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, exchange messages, and receive automatic notifications when they update their profile. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". As of September 2012, Facebook has over one billion active users, of which 8.7% are fake. Facebook (as of 2012) has about 180 petabytes of data per year and grows by over half a petabyte every 24 hours.</p>
    <p>In May 2005, Accel partners invested $12.7 million in Facebook, and Jim Breyer added $1 million of his own money. A January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> included the site on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember our co-workers' birthdays, bug our friends, and play a rousing game of Scrabulous before Facebook?" Facebook eventually filed for an initial public offering on February 1, 2012; it is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Facebook Inc. began selling stock to the public and trading on the NASDAQ on May 18, 2012. Based on its 2012 income of US$5.1 billion, Facebook joined the Fortune 500 list for the first time on the list published in May 2013, being placed at position 462.</p>
