		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 02 April 2014 </h1><h2> Jovian–Plutonian gravitational effect</h2><p>The <b>Jovian–Plutonian gravitational effect</b> is a hoax phenomenon stated to cause a noticeable short-term reduction in gravity on Earth that was invented for April Fools' Day by the English astronomer Patrick Moore and broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on 1 April 1976.</p>

He has appeared in films such as <i>I Heart Huckabees</i> (2004), <i>Shopgirl</i> (2005), <i>Marie Antoinette</i> (2006), <i>Funny People</i> (2009), and <i>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</i> (2010) and is perhaps best known for his frequent collaborations with Wes Anderson such as <i>Rushmore</i> (1998), <i>The Darjeeling Limited</i> (2007), <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i> (2009), <i>Moonrise Kingdom</i> (2012), and <i>The Grand Budapest Hotel</i> (2014). He currently releases music through solo-project Coconut Records; formerly, he was the drummer of the rock band Phantom Planet. Schwartzman was also the star of the HBO series <i>Bored to Death</i> (2009-11), where he played a writer who moonlights as an unlicensed detective, advertising himself on Craigslist.</p>

Highly popular in Armenia today, chess gained widespread recognition during the 1960s, when Soviet Armenian grandmaster Tigran Petrosian became the World Chess Champion. A country of about three million people, Armenia is considered one of the strongest chess nations today. Among countries, Armenia has one of the most chess grandmasters per capita.</p>
<p>Since the country's independence, the Armenian men's chess team has won the European Team Championship (1999), the World Team Championship (2011) and the Chess Olympiad (2006, 2008, 2012). The women's team had its crowning victory at the 2003 European Championship. As of December 2013, Armenia ranks sixth in the world by the average rating of its top players. Levon Aronian, Armenia's best chess player, is currently world No. 2 in the FIDE rankings. Aronian was a World Champion candidate in 2007, 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>Since the 2011–12 school year, chess lessons have been made part of the curriculum in every public school in Armenia, making it the first country in the world to make chess mandatory in schools.</p>

The first high-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> superconductor was discovered in 1986 by IBM researchers Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller, who were awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Physics "for their important break-through in the discovery of superconductivity in ceramic materials".</p>
<p>For an explanation about <b>T<sub>c</sub></b> (the critical temperature for supercondictivity), see Superconductivity#Superconducting phase transition and the second bullet item of BCS theory#Successes of the BCS theory.</p>
<p>Whereas "ordinary" or metallic superconductors usually have transition temperatures (temperatures below which they superconduct) below 30 K (−243.2 °C), HTS have been observed with transition temperatures as high as 138 K (−135 °C). Until 2008, only certain compounds of copper and oxygen (so-called "cuprates") were believed to have HTS properties, and the term high-temperature superconductor was used interchangeably with cuprate superconductor for compounds such as bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) and yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO). However, several iron-based compounds (the iron pnictides) are now known to be superconducting at high temperatures.</p>

It is the first installment in the <i>X-Men</i> film series. The film directed by Bryan Singer, written by David Hayter, and features an ensemble cast that includes Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, Bruce Davison, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn, Ray Park and Tyler Mane. It depicts a world in which a small proportion of people are mutants, whose possession of superhuman powers makes them distrusted by normal humans. The film focuses on the mutants Wolverine and Rogue as they are brought into a conflict between two groups that have radically different approaches to bringing about the acceptance of mutantkind: Professor Xavier's X-Men, and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto.</p>
<p>Development for <i>X-Men</i> began as far back as 1989 with James Cameron and Carolco Pictures. The film rights went to 20th Century Fox in 1994. Scripts and film treatments were commissioned from Andrew Kevin Walker, John Logan, Joss Whedon and Michael Chabon. Singer signed to direct in 1996, with further rewrites by Ed Solomon, Singer, Tom DeSanto, Christopher McQuarrie and David Hayter. Start dates kept getting pushed back, while Fox decided to move <i>X-Men'</i>s release date from December to July 2000. Filming took place from September 22, 1999 to March 3, 2000, primarily in Toronto. <i>X-Men</i> was released to positive reviews and was a financial success, starting the <i>X-Men</i> film franchise and spawning a reemergence of superhero films.</p>
