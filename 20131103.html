		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 03 November 2013 </h1><h2> Lucy (upcoming film)</h2><p><i><b>Lucy</b></i> is an upcoming French, English-language science fiction/Superhero film directed, written, and produced by Luc Besson. It stars Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman and Min-sik Choi.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_(upcoming_film)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Keegan-Michael Key</h2><p><b>Keegan-Michael Key</b> (born March 22, 1971) is an American actor and comedian best known for starring in the Comedy Central sketch series <i>Key &amp; Peele</i> and for his six seasons as a cast member on <i>MADtv</i>.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan-Michael_Key' >More...</a><hr><h2> Insular dwarfism</h2><p><b>Insular dwarfism</b>, a form of phyletic dwarfism, is the process and condition of the reduction in size of large animals over a number of generations when their population's range is limited to a small environment, primarily islands. This natural process is distinct from the intentional creation of dwarf breeds, called dwarfing. This process has occurred many times throughout evolutionary history, with examples including dinosaurs, like <i>Europasaurus</i>, and modern animals such as elephants and their relatives. This process, and other "island genetics" artifacts, can occur not only on traditional islands, but also in other situations where an ecosystem is isolated from external resources and breeding. This can include caves, desert oases, isolated valleys and isolated mountains ("sky islands"). Insular dwarfism is one aspect of the more general "island rule", which posits that when mainland animals colonize islands, small species tend to evolve larger bodies, and large species tend to evolve smaller bodies.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_dwarfism' >More...</a><hr><h2> Grahame Donald</h2><p>Air Marshal Sir <b>David Grahame Donald</b> KCB DFC AFC RAF (27 July 1891 – 23 December 1976), often known as <b>Sir Grahame Donald</b>, was a Royal Naval Air Service pilot during World War I, a senior Royal Air Force officer between the wars and a senior RAF commander during World War II. In February 1939, Donald was appointed Director of Organisation at the Air Ministry. He was also a rugby union international having represented Scotland twice in 1914.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grahame_Donald' >More...</a><hr><h2> German camp brothels in World War II</h2><p>In World War II, Nazi Germany established <b>brothels in the concentration camps</b> (<i>Lagerbordell</i>) to create an incentive for prisoners to collaborate, although these institutions were used mostly by Kapos, "prisoner functionaries" and the criminal element, because regular inmates, penniless and emaciated, were usually too debilitated and wary of exposure to SS schemes. In the end, the camp brothels did not produce any noticeable increase in the prisoners’ work productivity levels, but instead, created a market for coupons among the camp VIPs. The women forced into these brothels came mainly from the Ravensbrück concentration camp, except for Auschwitz, which employed its own prisoners. In combination with the German military brothels in World War II, it is estimated that at least 34,140 female inmates were forced to serve as prostitutes during the Third Reich.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_camp_brothels_in_World_War_II' >More...</a><hr><h2> Nemesis (mythology)</h2><p>In Greek mythology, <b>Nemesis</b> (Greek, Νέμεσις), also called <b>Rhamnousia/Rhamnusia</b> ("the goddess of Rhamnous") at her sanctuary at Rhamnous, north of Marathon, was the spirit of divine retribution against those who succumb to hubris (arrogance before the gods). Another name was <b>Adrasteia</b>, meaning "the inescapable." The Greeks personified vengeful fate as a remorseless goddess: the goddess of revenge. The name <i>Nemesis</i> is related to the Greek word νέμειν [némein], meaning "to give what is due".</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_(mythology)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Pavel Bure</h2><p><b>Pavel Vladimirovich Bure</b> (Russian: Па́вел Влади́мирович Буре́, <small>IPA: </small>[ˈpavʲɪl buˈre]; born March 31, 1971) is a retired Russian professional ice hockey right winger. Nicknamed "The Russian Rocket" for his speed, Bure played for 12 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Vancouver Canucks, Florida Panthers and New York Rangers. Trained in the Soviet Union, where he was known as "Pasha", he played three seasons with the Central Red Army team before his NHL career.</p>
<p>Selected 113th overall in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft by Vancouver, he began his NHL career in 1991–92 and won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's best rookie, then helped the Canucks to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1994. After seven seasons with the Canucks, Bure was dealt to the Panthers, where he won back-to-back Rocket Richard Trophies as the league's leading goal-scorer (he also led the league in goal scoring with Vancouver in 1993–94, before the trophy's inauguration). Bure struggled with knee injuries throughout his career, resulting in his retirement in 2005 as a member of the Rangers, although he had not played since 2003. He averaged better than a point per game in his NHL career (779 points with 437 goals in 702 NHL games) and is third all-time in goals per game. After six years of eligibility, Bure was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame in June 2012.</p>
<p>Internationally, Bure competed for the Soviet Union and Russia. As a member of the Soviet Union, he won two silver medals and a gold in three World Junior Championships, followed by a gold and a silver medal in the 1990 and 1991 World Championships, respectively. After the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, Bure competed for Russia in two Winter Olympics, winning silver at the 1998 Games in Nagano and bronze at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City. Following Bure's retirement in 2005, he was named the general manager for Russia's national team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. Bure was later recognized for his international career as a 2012 inductee in the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Bure' >More...</a><hr><h2> Artpop</h2><p><i><b>Artpop</b></i> (stylized as <i><b>ARTPOP</b></i>) is the upcoming third studio album by American recording artist Lady Gaga, scheduled to be released on November 8, 2013, through Interscope Records. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second studio album, <i>Born This Way</i> (2011). Work continued into 2012, with the intention of releasing the record in early 2013, though an injury that Gaga sustained during her Born This Way Ball delayed its release into the later portion of the year.</p>
<p>Described by Gaga as "a celebration and a poetic musical journey", <i>Artpop</i> represents a musical departure from <i>Born This Way</i>. Having co-written and co-produced each of its fifteen tracks, she collaborated with producers including longtime colleagues DJ White Shadow and RedOne and newer partners including Madeon and Zedd to achieve her desired sound. Furthermore, the record features guest vocals from several new partners, including R. Kelly, T.I., Too Short and Twista.</p>
<p>Two singles have been released from <i>Artpop</i> thus far. Its lead single, "Applause", was released on August 12, 2013, and peaked at number four on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The second single, "Do What U Want", was released on October 21, 2013.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artpop' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-11-03 11:30:08 -0500 -->
