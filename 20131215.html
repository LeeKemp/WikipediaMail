		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 15 December 2013 </h1><h2> Wow! signal</h2><p>The <b>Wow! signal</b> was a strong narrowband radio signal detected by Jerry R. Ehman on August 15, 1977, while he was working on a SETI project at the Big Ear radio telescope of The Ohio State University, then located at Ohio Wesleyan University's Perkins Observatory in Delaware, Ohio. The signal bore the expected hallmarks of non-terrestrial and non-Solar System origin. It lasted for the full 72-second window that Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected again. The signal has been the subject of significant media attention.</p>
<p>Amazed at how closely the signal matched the expected signature of an interstellar signal in the antenna used, Ehman circled the signal on the computer printout and wrote the comment "Wow!" on its side. This comment became the name of the signal.</p>

During his freshman year at Ohio State University in 2002, he helped lead the Buckeyes to a national championship. In a widely unexpected move, Clarett was drafted on the first day of the 2005 NFL Draft with the final pick of the 3rd round (#101 overall) by the Denver Broncos. He is well known for unsuccessfully challenging the NFL's draft eligibility rules requiring a player to be three years removed from high school and for his tumultuous life outside of football, including his dismissal from Ohio State, several arrests, and later, imprisonment.</p>

It features a team of space travelers who travel through a wormhole. Nolan combined his idea with an existing script by his brother Jonathan Nolan that was developed in 2007 for Paramount Pictures and producer Lynda Obst. Nolan is producing the film with Obst and Emma Thomas. <i>Interstellar</i> stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine.</p>
<p>Warner Bros., who distributed Nolan's previous films, negotiated with Paramount, traditionally a rival studio, to have a financial stake in <i>Interstellar</i>. Legendary Pictures, who formerly partnered with Warner Bros., also sought a stake. The three studios co-financed the film, which is being produced under Nolan's label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions. The director also hired cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema since his previous collaborator Wally Pfister was busy working on <i>Transcendence</i>, his directorial debut. <i>Interstellar</i> is being filmed with a combination of anamorphic 35mm and IMAX film photography. Principal photography began in August 2013 in the province of Alberta, Canada and continued in southern Iceland. <i>Interstellar</i> will be released on November 7, 2014. Paramount will distribute the film in the United States, and Warner Bros. will distribute the film in other territories.</p>
