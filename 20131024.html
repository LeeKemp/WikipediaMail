		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 24 October 2013 </h1><h2> Plagues of Egypt</h2><p>The <b>Plagues of Egypt</b> (Hebrew: מכות מצרים, <i>Makot Mitzrayim</i>), also called the <b>Ten Plagues</b> (Hebrew: עשר המכות, <i>Eser HaMakot</i>) or the <b>Biblical Plagues</b>, were ten calamities that, according to the biblical Book of Exodus, Israel's God, Yahweh, inflicted upon Egypt to persuade Pharaoh to release the ill-treated Israelites from slavery. Pharaoh capitulated after the tenth plague, triggering the Exodus of the Jewish people. The plagues were designed to contrast the power of Yahweh with the impotence of Egypt's various gods. Some commentators have associated several of the plagues with judgment on specific gods associated with the Nile, fertility and natural phenomena. The plagues of Egypt are also mentioned in the Quran (7,133–136). According to the Book of Exodus, God proclaims that all the gods of Egypt will be judged through the tenth and final plague:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn — both men and animals —and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD"</p>

Originating in the English village of Cheddar in Somerset, cheeses of this style are produced beyond this region and in several countries around the world.</p>
<p>The style is the most popular cheese in the United Kingdom, accounting for 51 percent of the country's £1.9 billion annual cheese market, and the second most popular cheese in the United States, behind mozzarella, with an average annual consumption of 10 lb (4.5 kg) per capita. The United States produced 3,233,380,000 lb (1,443,470 long tons; 1,466,640 tonnes) in 2010, and the UK 258,000 long tons (262,000 tonnes) in 2008. The name "cheddar cheese" is widely used and has no Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) within the European Union, but only cheddar produced from local milk within four counties of South West England may use the name "West Country Farmhouse Cheddar."</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheddar_cheese' >More...</a><hr><h2> Love Canal</h2><p><b>Love Canal</b> was a neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York, located in the LaSalle section of the city. It officially covers 36 square blocks in the far southeastern corner of the city, along 99th Street and Read Avenue. Two bodies of water define the northern and southern boundaries of the neighborhood: Bergholtz Creek to the north and the Niagara River one-quarter mile (400 m) to the south. In the mid-1970s Love Canal became the subject of national and international attention after it was revealed in the press that the site had formerly been used to bury 21,000 tons of toxic waste by Hooker Chemical (now Occidental Petroleum Corporation).</p>
<p>Hooker Chemical sold the site to the Niagara Falls School Board in 1953 for $1, with a deed explicitly detailing the presence of the waste, and including a liability limitation clause about the contamination. The construction efforts of housing development, combined with particularly heavy rainstorms, released the chemical waste, leading to a public health emergency and an urban planning scandal. Hooker Chemical was found to be negligent in their disposal of waste, though not reckless in the sale of the land, in what became a test case for liability clauses. The dumpsite was discovered and investigated by the local newspaper, the <i>Niagara Falls Gazette</i>, from 1976 through the evacuation in 1978. Potential health problems were first raised by reporter Michael H. Brown in July 1978.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p>Ten years after the incident, New York State Health Department Commissioner David Axelrod (not to be confused with former Senior Adivsor To President Barack Obama David Axelrod) stated that Love Canal would long be remembered as a "national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations." The Love Canal incident was especially significant as a situation where the inhabitants "overflowed into the wastes instead of the other way around."</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Canal' >More...</a><hr><h2> Manna Dey</h2><p><b>Prabodh Chandra Dey</b> (1 May 1919 − 24 October 2013), known by his stage name <b>Manna Dey</b>, was an Indian playback singer. He debuted in the film <i>Tamanna</i> in 1942, and went on to record more than 4000 songs during 1942-2013. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1971, the Padma Bhushan in 2005 and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2007.</p>
<p>Dey sang mainly in Hindi and Bengali; he also recorded songs in several other Indian languages. His peak period in Hindi playback singing is from 1953-1976.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna_Dey' >More...</a><hr><h2> Arrow (TV series)</h2><p><i><b>Arrow</b></i> is an American action adventure television series developed by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, and Andrew Kreisberg. It is based on the fictional superhero Green Arrow, a costumed crime-fighter who appears in comic books published by DC Comics. It premiered in North America on The CW on October 10, 2012, with international broadcasting to take place in late 2012. The series follows billionaire playboy Oliver Queen, portrayed by Stephen Amell, who, after five years of being stranded on a hostile island, returns home to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrows. <i>Arrow</i> will also feature appearances by other DC Comics characters. To assist in promotion, a preview comic book was released to tie into the television series.</p>
<p>On October 22, 2012, <i>Arrow</i> was picked up by The CW for a full season. On February 11, 2013, <i>Arrow</i> was renewed for a second season by The CW. The second season of <i>Arrow</i> premiered on October 9, 2013 and will feature 23 episodes.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(TV_series)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Adolf Hitler</h2><p><b>Adolf Hitler</b> (<small>German:</small> [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ]<small class="nowrap"> ( listen)</small>; 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Party (German: <i>Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</i> (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Führer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a <i>coup d'état</i> in Munich, known as the Beer Hall Putsch. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, <i>Mein Kampf</i> (<i>My Struggle</i>). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. After his appointment as chancellor in 1933, he transformed the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism.</p>
<p>Hitler's aim was to establish a New Order of absolute Nazi German hegemony in continental Europe. To this end, his foreign and domestic policies had the aim of seizing <i>Lebensraum</i> ("living space") for the Germanic people. He directed the rearmament of Germany and the invasion of Poland by the Wehrmacht in September 1939, resulting in the outbreak of World War II in Europe. Under Hitler's rule, in 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. In 1943, Germany was forced onto the defensive and suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time partner, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned.</p>
<p>Hitler's aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. His antisemitic policies and racially motivated ideology resulted in the deaths of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other people whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler' >More...</a><hr><h2> Zlatan Ibrahimović</h2><p><b>Zlatan Ibrahimović</b> (<small>Swedish pronunciation: </small>[ˈslaːtan ɪbraˈhiːmɔvɪtʂ], <small>Bosnian pronunciation: </small>[ˈzlatan ibraˈxiːmɔʋitɕ]; born 3 October 1981) is a Swedish professional footballer who plays as a striker for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Swedish national team for which he is captain. Ibrahimović started his career at Malmö FF in the late 1990s under Roland Andersson. He was signed by Ajax, and made a name for himself under Ronald Koeman. He later signed with Juventus for €16 million. Ibrahimović gained fame in Serie A, benefiting from his strike partnership with David Trezeguet.</p>
<p>In 2006, he signed with league rival Internazionale, where he won individual awards such as the Italian Oscar del Calcio and the Swedish Guldbollen, and was named in the 2007 and 2009 UEFA Team of the Year, in addition to finishing as the league's highest scorer in 2008–09 while winning three straight <i>Scudetti</i>. In the summer of 2009, he transferred to Barcelona. His time at Barcelona was short-lived, however, moving back to Serie A football with Milan the following season, in a deal which made him one of the highest paid footballers in the world and cost the Italian club €24 million. He signed a three-year contract with Paris Saint-Germain in July 2012.</p>
<p>He is regarded to be one of the most talented footballers of his generation. In 2012, he was ranked 5th in <i>The Guardian'</i>s <i>100 Best Footballers</i> in the world.</p>

The game is noted for being rich in strategy despite its relatively simple rules. According to chess master Emanuel Lasker: "The rules of Go are so elegant, organic, and rigorously logical that if intelligent life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, they almost certainly play Go."</p>
<p>The two players alternately place black and white playing pieces, called "stones", on the vacant intersections (called "points") of a grid of 19×19 lines (beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards). The object of the game is to use one's stones to surround a larger total area of the board than the opponent. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if captured; this is done by surrounding an opposing stone or group of stones by occupying all orthogonally-adjacent points. Players continue in this fashion until neither player wishes to make another move; the game has no set ending conditions. When a game concludes, the controlled points (territory) are counted along with captured stones to determine who has more points. Games may also be won by resignation.</p>
<p>Go originated in ancient China. Archaeological evidence shows that the early game was played on a board with a 17×17 grid, but by the time the game had spread to Korea and Japan, in about the 5th and 7th centuries AD respectively, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard.</p>
<p>As of mid-2008 there were well over 40 million Go players worldwide, the overwhelming majority living in East Asia. As of May 2012<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup>, the International Go Federation has a total of 74 member countries and four Association Members covering multiple countries.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Iris Chang</h2><p><b>Iris Shun-Ru Chang</b> (March 28, 1968 – November 9, 2004) was an American historian and journalist. She is best known for her best-selling 1997 account of the Nanking Massacre, <i>The Rape of Nanking</i>. She committed suicide on November 9, 2004. Chang is the subject of the 2007 biography, <i>Finding Iris Chang</i>, and the 2007 documentary film <i>Iris Chang: The Rape of Nanking</i>.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_Chang' >More...</a><hr><h2> Blueshift</h2><p>A <b>blueshift</b> is any decrease in wavelength (increase in frequency); the opposite effect is referred to as redshift. In visible light, this shifts the color from the red end of the spectrum to the blue end. The term also applies when photons outside the visible spectrum (<i>e.g.</i> x-rays and radio waves) are shifted toward shorter wavelengths, as well as to shifts in the de Broglie wavelength of particles. Blueshift is most commonly caused by relative motion toward the observer, described by the Doppler effect. An observer in a gravity well will also see infalling radiation gravitationally blueshifted, described by General Relativity in the same way as gravitational redshift. In a contracting universe, cosmological blueshift would be observed; the expanding universe gives a cosmological redshift, and the expansion is observed to be accelerating.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueshift' >More...</a><hr><h2> Google</h2><p><b>Google Inc.</b> is an American multinational corporation specializing in Internet-related services and products. These include search, cloud computing, software, and online advertising technologies. Most of its profits are derived from AdWords.</p>
<p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University. Together they own about 16 percent of its shares. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. Its mission statement from the outset was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful", and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil". In 2006 Google moved to headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.</p>
<p>Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine. It offers online productivity software including email (Gmail), an office suite (Google Drive), and social networking (Google+). Desktop products include applications for web browsing, organizing and editing photos, and instant messaging. The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system and the browser-only Chrome OS for a netbook known as a Chromebook. Google has moved increasingly into communications hardware: it partners with major electronics manufacturers in production of its high-end Nexus devices and acquired Motorola Mobility in May 2012. In 2012, a fiber-optic infrastructure was installed in Kansas City to facilitate a Google Fiber broadband service.</p>
<p>The corporation has been estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers around the world and to process over one billion search requests and about 24 petabytes of user-generated data each day. In December 2012 Alexa listed google.com as the most visited website in the world. Numerous Google sites in other languages figure in the top one hundred, as do several other Google-owned sites such as YouTube and Blogger. Its market dominance has led to criticism over issues including copyright, censorship, and privacy.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google' >More...</a><hr><h2> USS Forrestal (CV-59)</h2><p>The <b>USS <i>Forrestal</i> (CV-59)</b>, formerly <b>AVT-59</b> and <b>CVA-59</b>, is a supercarrier that was named after former Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal and was the lead ship of her class of aircraft carriers. The other carriers of her class were the USS <i>Saratoga</i>, USS <i>Ranger</i> and USS <i>Independence</i>. She superseded <i>Shinano</i> of World War II vintage as the largest aircraft carrier ever built by full load displacement and was the first to specifically support jet aircraft. The ship was affectionately called "The FID", because James Forrestal was the first ever Secretary of Defense, FID standing for "<b>F</b>irst <b>I</b>n <b>D</b>efense". This is also the slogan on the ship's insignia and patch. She was also informally known in the fleet as the "USS Zippo" and "Forest Fire" or "Firestal" because of a number of highly publicized fires on board, most notably a 1967 incident in which 134 sailors died and 161 were injured.</p>
<p><i>Forrestal</i> was launched 11 December 1954 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Newport News, Virginia, sponsored by Josephine Forrestal, widow of Secretary Forrestal; and commissioned 1 October 1955, Captain R. L. Johnson in command. The construction cost of the <i>Forrestal</i> just before commissioning was estimated to be $218 million.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Forrestal_(CV-59)' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-10-24 16:27:37 -0400 -->
