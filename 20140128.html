		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 28 January 2014 </h1><h2> Darlin' (band)</h2><p><b>Darlin'</b> was a French rock band formed in 1992 by Laurent Brancowitz, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. Their name was taken from the Beach Boys song of the same name.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlin%27_%28band%29' >More...</a><hr><h2> Pete Seeger</h2><p><b>Peter "Pete" Seeger</b> (May 3, 1919 – January 27, 2014) was an American folk singer. A fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s, he also had a string of hit records during the early 1950s as a member of the Weavers, most notably their recording of Lead Belly's "Goodnight, Irene", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950. Members of the Weavers were blacklisted during the McCarthy Era. In the 1960s, he re-emerged on the public scene as a prominent singer of protest music in support of international disarmament, civil rights, counterculture and environmental causes.</p>
<p>As a songwriter, he was the author or co-author of "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" (with Joe Hickerson), "If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)" (composed with Lee Hays of the Weavers), and "Turn, Turn, Turn!", which have been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement and are still sung throughout the world. "Flowers" was a hit recording for the Kingston Trio (1962); Marlene Dietrich, who recorded it in English, German and French (1962); and Johnny Rivers (1965). "If I Had a Hammer" was a hit for Peter, Paul &amp; Mary (1962) and Trini Lopez (1963), while the Byrds popularized "Turn, Turn, Turn!" in the mid-1960s, as did Judy Collins in 1964 and the Seekers in 1966.</p>
<p>Seeger was one of the folksingers most responsible for popularizing the spiritual "We Shall Overcome" (also recorded by Joan Baez and many other singer-activists) that became the acknowledged anthem of the 1960s American Civil Rights Movement, soon after folk singer and activist Guy Carawan introduced it at the founding meeting of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960. In the PBS <i>American Masters</i> episode "Pete Seeger: The Power of Song", Seeger stated it was he who changed the lyric from the traditional "We will overcome" to the more singable "We shall overcome".</p>

He is best known for his role as Mac on the FX series <i>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</i>. He is also credited as creator, developer, and executive producer of the show, which has also provided him with writing and directing credits on various episodes.</p>

The affair and its repercussions, which included the impeachment of Clinton, became known as the Lewinsky scandal.</p>
<p>After the scandal subsided, Lewinsky put out a line of handbags under her name, became an advertising spokesperson for a diet plan, worked as a television personality, moved to London, and obtained a master's degree in psychology.</p>

The show was renewed for the final season on December 21, 2012, after cast member Jason Segel changed his decision to leave the show after Season 8. Cristin Milioti, who was revealed as "The Mother" in the Season 8 finale, was promoted to a series regular, the first time <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> added a new regular cast member. Season 9 will consist of 24 episodes, each running approximately 22 minutes in length.</p>
<p>Taking place immediately after where the previous season left off, Season 9 will cover the events of a single weekend that lead up to Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) and Robin's (Cobie Smulders) wedding. During the course of the weekend, "The Mother" (Milioti) will separately be introduced to Robin, Barney, Lily (Alyson Hannigan), and Marshall (Segel), before finally meeting Ted (Josh Radnor). The season will also feature frequent flashbacks and flashfowards in order to fully integrate The Mother's character with the rest of the cast. Thomas said in an interview that Season 9 is like "the Wild West - anything can happen".</p>
<p>In February 2013, Bays and Thomas teased that Season 9 is "going to be a new way to tell the story". The initial reaction to the new storytelling structure of Season 9 was mixed. Ethan Anderton from <i>Screen Rant</i> was concerned about how "24 episodes of television are going to be crafted from just three days of time", and Alan Sepinwall of <i>HitFix</i> was exasperated that after eight seasons, "They are really going to stretch Robin and Barney's wedding weekend out over the entire final season," though he expressed more optimism after the San Diego Comic-Con panel for the final season.</p>
