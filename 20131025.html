		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 25 October 2013 </h1><h2> Dashrath Manjhi</h2><p>Coordinates: 24.877093°N 85.242956°E﻿ / 24.877093; 85.242956</p>

<p><b>Dashrath Manjhi</b> (1934 – August 17, 2007) was born into a poor labourer family in Gahlour village near Gaya in Bihar, India. He is also known as Mountain Man. Manjhi's wife, Falguni Devi, died due to lack of medical treatment because the nearest town with a doctor was 70 kilometres (43 mi) away from their village in Bihar, India.</p>
<p>Manjhi did not want anyone else to suffer the same fate as his wife, so he carved a path 360-foot-long (110 m) through-cut, 25-foot-deep (7.6 m) in places and 30-foot-wide (9.1 m) to form a road through a mountain in the Gehlour hills, working day and night for 22 years from 1960 to 1982. His feat reduced the distance between the Atri and Wazirganj blocks of the Gaya district from 50 km to 15 km, bringing him national acclaim. He died on August 17, 2007. He was given a state funeral by the Government of Bihar.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashrath_Manjhi' >More...</a><hr><h2> Low-background steel</h2><p><b>Low-background steel</b> is steel produced prior to the end of World War II.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> Following Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the nuclear weapons testing during the Cold War, world background radiation levels increased 7% across all radioactive elements.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> Steel produced during or after this testing became contaminated with certain radionuclides and consequently, is unsuitable for certain radiation-sensitive purposes.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> However, anthropogenic background radiation levels have fallen again since the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty - The man-made radioactive elements in the air have decayed to a 0.5% increase on naturally occurring levels.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-background_steel' >More...</a><hr><h2> Benedict Cumberbatch</h2><p><b>Benedict Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch</b> (born 19 July 1976) is an English film, television, theatre and voice actor.</p>

<p>Like the name of the series itself, with the exception of the first episode—"Pilot"—episode titles of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> always start with "<i>The</i>" and resemble the name of a scientific principle, theory or experiment, whimsically referencing a plot point or quirk.</p>
<p>As of October 24, 2013 (2013-10-24)<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup>, 141 episodes have aired.</p>
<p><i>The Big Bang Theory</i> has been renewed for a seventh season, which premiered on September 26, 2013.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_episodes' >More...</a><hr><h2> Charles Krauthammer</h2><p><b>Charles Krauthammer</b> (/ˈkraʊt.hæmər/; born March 13, 1950) is an American Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated columnist, political commentator, and physician. His column is syndicated to more than 350 newspapers and media outlets. He is a contributing editor to the <i>Weekly Standard</i>, a weekly panelist on the PBS news program <i>Inside Washington</i>, and a nightly panelist on Fox News's <i>Special Report with Bret Baier</i>.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Krauthammer' >More...</a><hr><h2> IPv6</h2><p><b>Internet Protocol version 6</b> (<b>IPv6</b>) is the latest revision of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.</p>
<p>IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4, which still carries the vast majority of Internet traffic as of 2013. As of September 2013<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup>, the percentage of users reaching Google services over IPv6 surpassed 2% for the first time.</p>
<p>Every device on the Internet must be assigned an IP address in order to communicate with other devices. With the ever-increasing number of new devices being connected to the Internet, the need arose for more addresses than IPv4 is able to accommodate. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address, allowing 2<sup>128</sup>, or approximately 3.4×10<sup>38</sup> addresses, or more than 7.9×10<sup>28</sup> times as many as IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses. IPv4 allows only approximately 4.3 billion addresses. The two protocols are not designed to be interoperable, complicating the transition to IPv6.</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons, for example 2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334, but methods of abbreviation of this full notation exist.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-10-25 11:30:08 -0400 -->
