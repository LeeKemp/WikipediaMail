Ukraine borders the Russian Federation to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary to the west, Romania and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. It has an area of 603,628 km<sup>2</sup> (233,062 sq mi), making it the largest country entirely within Europe.</p>
<p>The territory of Ukraine was first inhabited at least 44,000 years ago, with the country being a candidate site for both the domestication of the horse and for the origins of the Indo-European language family.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, the area became a key center of East Slavic culture, as epitomized by the powerful state of Kievan Rus'. Following its fragmentation in the 13th century, Ukraine was contested, ruled, and divided by a variety of powers. A Cossack republic emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries, but Ukraine remained otherwise divided until its consolidation into a Soviet republic in the twentieth century, becoming an independent nation-state only in 1991.</p>
<p>Ukraine has long been a global breadbasket due to its fertile conditions. As of 2011, it was the world's third-largest grain exporter with that year's harvest being much larger than average. Ukraine is one of ten most attractive agricultural land acquisition regions. In addition</p>
<p>Ukraine is a unitary state composed of 24 oblasts (provinces), one autonomous republic (Crimea), and two cities with special status: Kiev, its capital and largest city, and Sevastopol, which houses the Russian Black Sea Fleet under a leasing agreement. Ukraine is a republic under a semi-presidential system with separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine continues to maintain the second-largest military in Europe, after that of Russia. The country is home to 44.6 million people, 77.8 percent of whom are ethnic Ukrainians, with sizable minorities of Russians (17%), Belarusians and Romanians. Ukrainian is the official language of Ukraine; its alphabet is Cyrillic. Russian is also widely spoken. The dominant religion in the country is Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which has strongly influenced Ukrainian architecture, literature and music.</p>
<p>Scholars disagree on whether the origin of the name of Ukraine meant "borderland" or "homeland". The form "the Ukraine" was once usual in English. Since the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, the English-speaking world has largely stopped using the article.</p>

<p>Born in Harpurhey, Manchester, Thorpe originally worked as a clerk, but in 1863 began working as an assistant to Henry Roscoe, a professor of chemistry at Owen's College. Thorpe then studied for a PhD at the University of Heidelberg, and after a time working for August Kekulé in Bonn returned to Britain to accept a Chair at Anderson's University in Glasgow in 1870. He later held posts at the Yorkshire College of Science and the Normal School of Science, South Kensington (later the Royal College of Science).</p>
<p>Thorpe conducted research on a wide range of subjects. He contributed to the understanding of the relationship between substances' molecular weights and their specific gravities, and his work on phosphorus compounds led to a better understanding of phosphorus trioxide and the prevention of the illnesses it caused to workers in the match industry. Thorpe's work on the atomic weights of metals led to the award of a Royal Medal in 1889, and in 1902 Thorpe was elected member of the newly created International Atomic Weights Commission. He also took part in four eclipse expeditions, and a magnetic survey of the British Isles.</p>
<p>In 1895 Thorpe served as president of the Society of Chemical Industry. He left academia in 1894 to take up a government post as principal of Somerset House Laboratory, also known as the Government Laboratory, originally established in 1842 for the prevention of the adulteration of tobacco products and then enhanced by the 1875 Sale of Food and Drugs Law. In this post from 1894 to 1909, he moved the government laboratory in 1897 from Somerset House to a new building of his own design and helped to further the effectiveness and reputation of this government laboratory. With his staff Thorpe worked on matters of public health, including the detection of arsenic in beer, and the elimination of lead from pottery. His successor as principal chemist of the Government Laboratories was James Johnston Dobbie.</p>
<p>Thorpe wrote a number of books, including the textbooks <i>Inorganic Chemistry</i> (1873), <i>Dictionary of Applied Chemistry</i> (1890) and a <i>History of Chemistry</i> (1909). Outside chemistry, his great interest was yachting, and he wrote two books on this subject; <i>A Yachtsman's Guide to the Dutch Waterways</i> (1905) and <i>The Seine from Havre to Paris</i> (1913).</p>
<p>Thorpe died of a heart attack in 1925, and was buried in Salcombe, Devon.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edward_Thorpe' >More...</a><hr><h2> Ted Thorpe (footballer born 1898)</h2><p><b>Edwin "Ted" Thorpe</b> (born 1898, date of death unknown) was an English footballer.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Thorpe_(footballer_born_1898)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Edward Thorpe (disambiguation)</h2><p> </p>
