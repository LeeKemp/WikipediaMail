		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 07 May 2014 </h1><h2> Harald Bluetooth</h2><p><b>Harald "Bluetooth" Gormsson</b> (Old Norse: <i>Haraldr blátǫnn Gormsson</i>, Danish: <i>Harald Blåtand Gormsen</i>) (probably born c. 935) was a King of Denmark and Norway. He was the son of King Gorm the Old and of Thyra Dannebod. He died in 985 or 986 having ruled as King of Denmark from c. 958 and King of Norway for a few years probably around 970. Some sources say his son Sweyn Forkbeard forcibly deposed him as King.</p>

The affair and its repercussions, which included the Clinton impeachment, became known as the Lewinsky scandal.</p>
<p>As a result of the scandal, Lewinsky gained worldwide celebrity; she subsequently engaged in a variety of ventures including designing a line of handbags under her name, being an advertising spokesperson for a diet plan, working as a television personality, and finally moving to London to pursue a master's degree in psychology.</p>

The USA is the most successful team in international competition, winning medals in all seventeen Olympic tournaments it has entered, coming away with fourteen golds. Two of its gold medal-winning squads were inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as teams in August 2010—the 1960 team, which featured six Hall of Famers (4 players, 2 coaches), and the 1992 "Dream Team", featuring 14 Hall of Famers (11 players, 3 coaches). The United States is currently ranked first in the FIBA World Rankings.</p>
<p>Traditionally composed of amateur players, a 1989 rule change by FIBA allowed USA Basketball to field teams with professional players. The first such team, known as the "Dream Team", won the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, playing in the final against Croatia.</p>
<p>With the introduction of professionals, the team was able to spark a second run of dominance after capturing only a bronze medal in 1988. A team of professional players competed at the 1994 FIBA World Championship, finishing first. In 1996, 2000, 2008, and 2012 the USA again captured gold medals.</p>
<p>Facing increased competition, the USA failed to win a medal at the 2002 FIBA World Championship, finishing sixth. The 2004 Summer Olympic team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal, a record that represented more losses in a single year than the country's Olympic teams had suffered in all previous Olympiads combined.</p>
<p>Determined to put an end to these failures, USA Basketball initiated a long-term project aimed at creating better, more cohesive teams. The USA won its first seven games at the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan before losing against Greece in the semi-finals, ending the competition with the bronze medal. The USA won gold two years later, though, at the 2008 Summer Olympics with a dominant performance. This success was followed up at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, where despite fielding a roster featuring no players from the 2008 Olympic team, the USA did not lose a single game en route to defeating host Turkey for the gold medal. The USA continued this streak of dominance by going undefeated and capturing gold once more at the 2012 Summer Olympics.<br></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men%27s_national_basketball_team' >More...</a><hr><h2> Eurovision Song Contest 2014</h2><p>The <b>Eurovision Song Contest 2014</b> is the 59th annual Eurovision Song Contest. The contest is taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark, following Emmelie de Forest's win in the 2013 contest with the song "Only Teardrops". This will be the third time that Denmark will host the contest, the previous time being in 2001. The two semi-finals take place on 6 May and 8 May 2014, and the final on 10 May 2014. The host broadcaster, DR, chose the B&amp;W Hallerne as the host venue after considering several bids from cities and venues across Denmark. The shows will be presented by Lise Rønne, Nikolaj Koppel and Pilou Asbæk. For the first time in the history of the contest, the trio of presenters comprises two men and one woman.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven countries have confirmed participation; this includes the return of Poland after a two-year absence and Portugal after a one-year absence. Overall, there are two fewer countries competing compared to the previous year, making thirty-seven participants, the smallest number since 2004. Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Serbia announced their withdrawal from the 2014 Contest. The contest sees the return of Valentina Monetta representing San Marino for a third consecutive year.</p>
<p>Royal Family members Crown Prince Frederik and his wife, Crown Princess Mary will be attending the final as guests.</p>
<p>Montenegro and San Marino qualified to the final for the first time since their debuts in 2007 and 2008 respectively.</p>

The similar Oreo cookie—introduced later, in 1912—was inspired by the Hydrox, yet Hydrox suffered from the impression of being the knockoff. Compared to Oreos, Hydrox cookies have a tangy, less-sweet filling and a crunchier cookie that gets less soggy in milk.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrox' >More...</a><hr><h2> Kevin Durant</h2><p><b>Kevin Wayne Durant</b> (born September 29, 1988) is an American professional basketball player with the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Standing at 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m) and weighing 240 pounds (109 kg), he has played the small forward and power forward positions for the Thunder, formerly the Seattle SuperSonics. Durant has won an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, and an Olympic gold medal. He has also been selected to four All-NBA teams and five All-Star teams.</p>
<p>Durant was a heavily recruited high school prospect. He attended the University of Texas for one season of college basketball, where he won numerous year-end awards and became the first ever freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. In the 2007 NBA Draft, he was selected second overall by the SuperSonics. After his rookie season, the team moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder. Behind his play, the Thunder reached the 2012 NBA Finals, losing to the Miami Heat in five games. His career achievements have led many basketball analysts to consider him the second best player in the NBA today behind LeBron James.</p>
<p>Off the court, Durant has accumulated considerable wealth as a result of numerous endorsement contracts as well as his NBA salary. A well-liked player, he is a philanthropist who has donated money to various causes and is popular in Oklahoma City for his kindness toward the community.
