		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 16 November 2013 </h1><h2> 1 yen coin</h2><p>The <b>1 yen coin</b> (一円硬貨, <i>Ichi-en kōka</i><sup>?</sup>) is the smallest denomination of the Japanese yen currency. The first Japanese one yen coin was minted in 1870. The current design was first minted in 1955.</p>

The word "rhyme" here is used in the strict sense, called a <i>perfect rhyme</i>, that the words are pronounced the same from the vowel of the main stressed syllable onwards. The list was compiled from the point of view of Received Pronunciation (with a few exceptions for General American), and may not work for other accents or dialects. Multiple-word rhymes (a phrase that rhymes with a word, known as a <i>phrasal</i> or <i>mosaic</i> rhyme), self-rhymes (adding a prefix to a word and counting it as a rhyme of itself), and identical rhymes (words that are identical in their stressed syllables, such as <i>bay</i> and <i>obey</i>) are often not counted as true rhymes and have not been considered. Only the list of one-syllable words can hope to be anything near complete; for polysyllabic words, rhymes are the exception rather than the rule.</p>

Atkinson first came to prominence in the sketch comedy show <i>Not the Nine O'Clock News</i> (1979–82), and via his participation in The Secret Policeman's Balls from 1979. His other work includes the sitcom <i>The Thin Blue Line</i> (1995–96).</p>
<p>He has been listed in <i>The Observer</i> as one of the 50 funniest actors in British comedy and amongst the top 50 comedians ever, in a 2005 poll of fellow comedians. He has also had cinematic success with his performances in the Mr. Bean movie adaptations <i>Bean</i> and <i>Mr. Bean's Holiday</i> and in <i>Johnny English</i> and its sequel <i>Johnny English Reborn</i>.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Atkinson' >More...</a><hr><h2> First Doctor</h2><p>The <b>First Doctor</b> is the initial incarnation of the protagonist of the long-running BBC television science fiction series <i>Doctor Who</i>. He was portrayed by the actor William Hartnell from 1963 to 1966. Hartnell reprised the role in the tenth anniversary story <i>The Three Doctors</i> in 1973 – albeit in a reduced capacity due to his ailing health. In 1983, actor Richard Hurndall played the part of the First Doctor in the 20th anniversary story <i>The Five Doctors</i>, as William Hartnell had died in 1975. A cinematic version of the character, Dr. Who, was played by Peter Cushing.</p>
<p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change. Hartnell's Doctor is the Doctor's "original" form. The regeneration plot device was introduced when Hartnell needed to leave the series, and consequently has extended the life of the show for many years. The First Doctor is the youngest incarnation of the Doctor, but has the most aged physical appearance, having grown old through a natural lifespan. The Doctor's ability to regenerate allows him to appear younger, effectively taking on a new body that has yet to wear down with age. Respectively, later incarnations would portray the Doctor with a younger appearance, though his natural age continues to rise.</p>

A noted public speaker, Asanuma was unusual in postwar Japan for his forceful advocacy of socialism, and his support of the Chinese Communist Party was particularly controversial.</p>
<p>Asanuma was assassinated by a right-wing nationalist while speaking in a televised political debate in Tokyo. His violent death was seen in graphic detail on national television, causing widespread public shock and outrage.</p>
