		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 31 December 2013 </h1><h2> Marge Simpson</h2><p><b>Marjorie</b> "<b>Marge</b>" <b>Simpson</b> (<i>née</i> <b>Bouvier</b>) is a fictional main character in the American animated sitcom <i>The Simpsons</i> and part of the eponymous family. She is voiced by Julie Kavner and first appeared on television in <i>The Tracey Ullman Show</i> short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Marge was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on <i>Life in Hell</i> but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his mother Margaret Groening. After appearing on <i>The Tracey Ullman Show</i> for three seasons, the Simpson family received their own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989.</p>
<p>Marge is the well-meaning and extremely patient matriarch of the Simpson family. With her husband Homer, she has three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. She is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother and is often included on lists of top "TV moms". She has appeared in other media relating to <i>The Simpsons</i>—including video games, <i>The Simpsons Movie</i>, <i>The Simpsons</i> Ride, commercials, and comic books—and inspired an entire line of merchandise.</p>
<p>Marge's distinctive blue beehive hairstyle was inspired by a combination of the Bride's in <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i> and the style that Margaret Groening wore in the 1960s. Julie Kavner, who was a member of the original cast of <i>The Tracey Ullman Show</i>, was asked to voice Marge so that more voice actors would not be needed. Kavner has won several awards for voicing Marge, including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992. She was also nominated for an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for her performance in <i>The Simpsons Movie</i>. In 2000, Marge, along with the rest of her family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>

French political activist and comedian Dieudonné M'bala M'bala is credited with creating and popularizing the gesture, which he first used publicly in 2009 while campaigning as a candidate for the 2009 European Parliament elections at the head of an "anti-Zionist" list. While Dieudonné says the quenelle is "an anti-establishment gesture," it takes the appearance of a Nazi salute in reverse, and critics describe it as an expression of antisemitism. In France, displaying Nazi symbols is illegal if done to cause offense, and the quenelle is viewed by some as an underhanded manner of expressing hatred for Jews without inviting legal prosecution.The negative intent of the gesture, they say, is further underlined by Dieudonné's history of anti-Semitic remarks and racial hatred convictions.</p>
<p>The location of a number of photographed quenelle salutes in front of prominent Holocaust landmarks and Jewish institutions further suggests the prejudicial nature of the gesture. Individuals have been photographed performing the gesture at the Auschwitz extermination camp in Poland, and French essayist and film-maker Alain Soral performed a quenelle in front of the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin. In September 2013, two French soldiers on duty had their picture taken in front of a Paris synagogue doing a quenelle. A man wearing a shirt featuring a portrait of Yasser Arafat was photographed performing a quenelle in front of a Jewish school in Toulouse, where in March 2012 a rabbi and three children were gunned down.</p>
<p>When French footballer Nicolas Anelka performed the quenelle to celebrate scoring a goal on 28 December 2013, the gesture, which was already considered "something of a viral trend" in France, became an international news story. While Anelka said he did a quenelle as a "special dedication" to his friend Dieudonné, French minister for sport Valérie Fourneyron called his actions "shocking" and "disgusting", adding: "There’s no place for anti-Semitism on the football field." In November, a photograph of French footballer Mamadou Sakho performing the quenelle with Dieudonné was discovered. Sakho said he had been tricked into making a quenelle without knowing its meaning, and that the photo had been taken six months earlier.</p>
<p>On 23 December 2013, French President Francois Hollande said, "We will act, with the government led by [Prime Minister] Jean-Marc Ayrault, to shake the tranquility which, under the cover of anonymity, facilitates shameful actions online. But also we will fight against the sarcasm of those who purport to be humorists but are actually professional anti-Semites." In a statement on 27 December 2013, France's Interior Minister Manuel Valls said he would consider "all legal means" to ban Dieudonné's "public meetings," given that he "addresses in an obvious and insufferable manner the memory of victims of the Shoah."</p>
<p>While Dieudonné said in August 2013 that "the quenelle had taken on a life of its own and had become something he could no longer claim as his exclusively," he has been working on launching a range of quenelle-related merchandise and in October 2013 his wife registered the quenelle as a trademark with the French National Industrial Property Institute.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenelle_(gesture)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Softsoap</h2><p><b>Softsoap</b> is the trade name of Colgate-Palmolive's liquid hand soap and body wash.</p>
<p>William Sheppard of New York was granted patent number 49,561 for his "Improved Liquid Soap" on August 22, 1865, for his discovery that a small amount of conventional soap could be mixed with large amounts of spirits of ammonia (or hartshorn, as it was known at the time) to create a soap with a consistency of molasses. His invention became common in public areas, but could generally not be found in homes.</p>
<p>In 1980, entrepreneur Robert R. Taylor (died August 29, 2013) began selling his product as Softsoap through his company, Minnetonka Corp. in Chaska, Minnesota. Taylor knew others would copy the soap-in-a-pump-bottle idea, so he shrewdly purchased 100 million small bottle hand-pumps from the only two U.S. manufacturers that made them, so that any competitors wouldn't be able to buy any for one year - enough time for him to establish the brand name. It worked; in six months, he sold $25 million worth of Softsoap. The package made it very easy to spot on store shelves when nearly all other soaps were in bar form. Taylor sold the Softsoap brand to Colgate-Palmolive in 1987.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softsoap' >More...</a><hr><h2> American Hustle (2013 film)</h2><p><i><b>American Hustle</b></i> is a 2013 American crime comedy-drama film directed by David O. Russell, from a screenplay written by Eric Warren Singer and Russell, loosely based on the FBI ABSCAM operation of the late 1970s and early '80s. It stars Christian Bale and Amy Adams as two con artists who are forced by an FBI agent (played by Bradley Cooper) to set up an elaborate sting operation on corrupt politicians, including the mayor of Camden, New Jersey (played by Jeremy Renner). Jennifer Lawrence supports the cast as the unpredictable wife of Bale's character.</p>
<p>Principal photography on <i>American Hustle</i> began on March 8, 2013 in Boston, Worcester, Massachusetts, and New York City. After a limited release on December 13, 2013 the film expanded nationwide on December 20, 2013. The film received near-universal critical acclaim and among others, has been nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards.</p>

Though credited to "Penelope Ashe", it was in fact written by a group of twenty-four journalists led by <i>Newsday</i> columnist Mike McGrady. McGrady's intention was to write a deliberately terrible book with a lot of sex, to illustrate the point that popular American literary culture had become mindlessly vulgar. The book fulfilled the authors' expectations and became a bestseller in 1969; they revealed the hoax later that year, further spurring the book's popularity.</p>
