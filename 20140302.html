		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 02 March 2014 </h1><h2> Will-o&#39;-the-wisp</h2><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will-o&#39;-the-wisp' >More...</a><hr><h2> Back to the Future</h2><p><i><b>Back to the Future</b></i> is a 1985 American science fiction comedy film. It was directed by Robert Zemeckis, written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale, produced by Steven Spielberg, and stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson. Fox plays Marty McFly, a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955. He meets his future parents in high school and accidentally attracts his mother's romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by causing his parents-to-be to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown (Lloyd), he must find a way to return to 1985.</p>
<p>Zemeckis and Gale wrote the script after Gale mused upon whether he would have befriended his father if they attended school together. Various film studios rejected the script until the financial success of Zemeckis' <i>Romancing the Stone</i>. Zemeckis approached Spielberg and the project was planned to be financed and released through Universal Pictures. The first choice for the role of Marty McFly was Michael J. Fox. He was busy filming his TV series <i>Family Ties</i> and the show's producers would not allow him to star in the film. Consequently, Eric Stoltz was cast in the role. During filming, Stoltz and the filmmakers decided that he was miscast, and Fox was approached for the part. Now with more flexibility in his schedule and the blessing of his show's producers, Fox managed to work out a timetable in which he could give enough time and commitment to both.</p>
<p><i>Back to the Future</i> was released on July 3, 1985 and became the most successful film of the year, grossing more than $383 million worldwide and receiving critical acclaim. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film, as well as an Academy Award, and Golden Globe nominations among others. Ronald Reagan even quoted the film in his 1986 State of the Union Address. In 2007, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, and in June 2008 the American Film Institute's special AFI's 10 Top 10 designated the film as the 10th-best film in the science fiction genre. The film marked the beginning of a franchise, with sequels <i>Back to the Future Parts II</i> and <i>III</i> released in 1989 and 1990, as well as an animated series, theme park ride and several video games.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future' >More...</a><hr><h2> Crimean War</h2><p>The <b>Crimean War</b> (pronounced /kraɪˈmiːən/ or /krɨˈmiːən/) (October 1853 – February 1856) was a conflict in which Russia lost to an alliance of France, Britain, the Ottoman Empire, and Sardinia. While neutral, Austria played a role in stopping the Russians.</p>
<p>The immediate issue involved the rights of Christians in the Holy Land, which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Orthodox. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire, and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. Russia lost and the Ottomans gained a twenty-year respite from Russian pressure. The Christians were granted a degree of official equality and the Orthodox gained control of the Christian churches in dispute. Russia survived, gained a new appreciation for its religious diversity, and launched a reform program with far-reaching consequences. According to Shepard Clough, professor of history at Columbia University, the war:</p>
<dl><dd>"was not the result of a calculated plan, nor even of hasty last-minute decisions made under stress. It was the consequence of more than two years of fatal blundering in slow-motion by inept statesmen who had months to reflect upon the actions they took. It arose from Napoleon's search for prestige; Nicholas’s quest for control over the Straits; his naïve miscalculation of the probable reactions of the European powers; the failure of those powers to make their positions clear; and the pressure of public opinion in Britain and Constantinople at crucial moments."</dd>
</dl><p>Russia and the Ottoman Empire went to war in October 1853 over Russia's rights to protect Orthodox Christians. Russia gained the upper hand after destroying the Ottoman fleet at the Black Sea port of Sinope; to stop Russia's conquest, France and Britain entered in March 1854. Most of the fighting took place for control of the Black Sea, with land battles on the Crimean peninsula in southern Russia. The Russians held their great fortress at Sevastopol for over a year. After it fell, peace became possible, and was arranged at Paris in March 1856. The religion issue had already been resolved. The main results were that the Black Sea was neutralised—Russia would not have any warships there—and the two vassals Wallachia and Moldavia became largely independent under nominal Ottoman rule.</p>
<p>There were smaller campaigns in eastern Anatolia, Caucasus, the Baltic Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the White Sea. In Russia, this war is also known as the "<b>Eastern War</b>" (Russian: Восточная война, <i>Vostochnaya Voina</i>).</p>
<p>The war transformed the region. Because of battles, population exchanges, and nationalist movements incited by the war, the present-day states of Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, and regions such as Crimea and the Caucasus all changed in small or large ways due to this conflict.</p>
<p>The Crimean War is notorious for logistical, medical and tactical failure on both sides. The naval side saw both a successful Allied campaign which eliminated most of the ships of the Russian Navy in the Black Sea, and a successful blockade by the Royal Navy in the Baltic. It was one of the first "modern" wars because it saw the first use of major technologies, such as railways and telegraphs. It is also famous for the work of Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole, who pioneered contrasting modern medical practices while treating the wounded.</p>
<p>The Crimean War was one of the first wars to be documented extensively in written reports and photographs: notably by William Russell (writing for <i>The Times</i> newspaper) and the photographs of Roger Fenton. News from war correspondents reached all nations involved in the war and kept the public citizenry of those nations better informed of the day-to-day events of the war than had been the case in any other war to that date. The British public was very well informed regarding the day-to-day realities of the war in the Crimea. After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea during the winter of 1854, the news reached London in two days. When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours. The daily news reports energised public opinion, which brought down the Aberdeen government and carried Lord Palmerston into office as prime minister.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War' >More...</a><hr><h2> 2014 Crimean crisis</h2><p>The <b>2014 Crimean crisis</b> is unfolding in the autonomous region of Crimea, Ukraine, in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, in which the government of President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted. Protests were staged by Pro-Russian groups who opposed the events in Kiev and wanted closer ties or integration with Russia, in addition to expanded autonomy or possible independence for Crimea. Other groups, predominantly consisting of Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians, protested in support of the revolution.</p>
<p>On 27 February, armed men wearing masks seized a number of important buildings in Crimea, including the parliament building and two airports.  They destroyed almost all telecommunication and Internet service between Crimea and the rest of Ukraine. Under siege, the Supreme Council of Crimea dismissed the autonomous republic's government and replaced chairman of the Council of Ministers of Crimea, Anatolii Mohyliov with Sergey Aksyonov.</p>
<p>The Russian troops stationed in Crimea on bilateral agreement were being reinforced and two vessels of the Russian Baltic Fleet breached Ukrainian waters.</p>
<p>Kiev accused Russia of intervening in Ukraine's internal affairs, while the Russian side officially denied such claims. On 1 March, the Russian parliament granted President Vladimir Putin the authority to use military force in Ukraine, following a plea for help from unofficial pro-Moscow leader, Sergey Aksyonov.</p>
<p>On the same day, the acting president of Ukraine, Oleksandr Turchynov decreed the appointment of the Prime Minister of Crimea as unconstitutional. And there was information that there may have been falsification during the vote on referendum and change of government in Crimea. The General Prosecutor office informed that any decisions on referendum contradict the Constitution of Ukraine and Crimea.</p>
<p>On 2 March, several Ukrainian military objects were reported under siege or assaulted as Ukraine declared full battle alert and general mobilization across the country. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense announced that there were attempts of disinformation which claimed about surrendering of Ukrainian military in Crimea and do not correspond the reality. The United States and its allies have condemned Russia's invasion of Crimea, urging Russia to withdraw.</p>

<p>The film underwent several story treatments for several years, before being commissioned in 2011, with a screenplay written by Jennifer Lee, and both Chris Buck and Lee serving as directors. Christophe Beck, who had worked on Disney's award-winning short <i>Paperman</i>, was hired to compose the film's orchestral score, while husband-and-wife songwriting team Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez penned the songs.</p>
<p><i>Frozen</i> premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 19, 2013, and went into general theatrical release on November 27. The film has so far grossed over $1 billion in worldwide box office revenue, $388 million of which has been earned in the United States and Canada; it has been met with widespread critical acclaim, with several film critics considering it to be the best Disney animated musical since the studio's renaissance era. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film, five Annie Awards (including Best Animated Feature), two Critics' Choice Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for "Let It Go," and has received Academy Award (Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song), and Satellite Award nominations.</p>

Tattoo artists usually learn their craft via an apprenticeship under a trained and experienced mentor.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo_artist' >More...</a><hr><h2> Allen Iverson</h2><p><b>Allen Ezail Iverson</b> (born June 7, 1975), nicknamed <b>A.I.</b> and <b>The Answer</b>, is a former American professional basketball player. He played both the point guard and shooting guard positions. Iverson attended Bethel High School in Hampton, Virginia and was a dual-sport athlete; he earned the Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both football and basketball, and won the Division AAA Virginia state championship in both sports. After high school, Iverson attended Georgetown University for two years, where he set the school record for career scoring average (22.9 points per game) and won Big East Defensive Player of the Year awards both years.</p>
<p>Following two successful years at Georgetown, Iverson declared eligibility for the 1996 NBA Draft, and was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the number one pick. He was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in the 1996–97 season. Iverson was an eleven-time NBA All-Star and won the All-Star MVP award in 2001 and 2005.</p>
<p>Winning the NBA scoring title during the 1998–99, 2000–01, 2001–02 and 2004–05 seasons, Iverson was one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, despite his small stature (listed at 6 feet, 0 inches).
