		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 31 October 2013 </h1><h2> Shroud of Turin</h2><p>The <b>Shroud of Turin</b> or <b>Turin Shroud</b> (Italian: <i>Sindone di Torino</i>) is a length of linen cloth bearing the image of a man who appears to have suffered physical trauma in a manner consistent with crucifixion. It is believed by some to be the burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth, despite radiocarbon dating placing its origins in the Medieval period. The image is much clearer in black-and-white negative than in its natural sepia color. The negative image was first observed in 1898, on the reverse photographic plate of amateur photographer Secondo Pia, who was allowed to photograph it while it was being exhibited in the Turin Cathedral. It is kept in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, northern Italy.</p>
<p>The origins of the shroud and its image are the subject of intense debate among theologians, historians and researchers. Scientific and popular publications have presented diverse arguments for both authenticity and possible methods of forgery. A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The Catholic Church has neither formally endorsed nor rejected the shroud, but in 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus. More recently, Pope Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI have both described the Shroud of Turin as “an icon”.</p>
<p>In 1978, a detailed examination carried out by a team of American scientists, called the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP), found no reliable evidence of how the image was produced. In 1988 a radiocarbon dating test was performed on small samples of the shroud. The laboratories at the University of Oxford, the University of Arizona, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology concurred that the samples they tested dated from the Middle Ages, between 1260 and 1390. Since 2005, at least four scholarly articles have been published in various sources stating that the samples used for the dating test may not have been representative of the whole Shroud. The people who performed the dating process, a former scientist who studied the radiographs and transmitted light images taken by STURP, a textile expert who handled the shroud during its 2002 restoration process and a carbon-dating expert who examined a surviving portion of the original radiocarbon sample have all individually confirmed that the radiocarbon sample was part of the original cloth, and was not part of any later repair.</p>
<p>According to former <i>Nature</i> editor Philip Ball, "it's fair to say that, despite the seemingly definitive tests in 1988, the status of the Shroud of Turin is murkier than ever. Not least, the nature of the image and how it was fixed on the cloth remain deeply puzzling". The shroud continues to remain one of the most studied and controversial artifacts in human history.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin' >More...</a><hr><h2> Boston Red Sox</h2><p>The <b>Boston Red Sox</b> are a professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts, and a member of Major League Baseball's American League Eastern Division. Founded in 1901 as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox's home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912. The "Red Sox" name was chosen by the team owner, John I. Taylor, around 1908, following previous Boston teams that had been known as the "Red Stockings". They have played in 12 World Series, winning eight.</p>
<p>Boston was a dominant team in the new league, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918. However, they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history, called by some the "Curse of the Bambino" after its alleged beginning with the Red Sox's sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918, an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Championship in 2004. However, the team's history during that period was hardly one of futility, but was rather punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history, including Enos Slaughter's "mad dash" in 1946, the "Impossible Dream" of 1967, Carlton Fisk's home run in 1975, and Bill Buckner's error in 1986. Red Sox history has also been marked by the team's intense rivalry with the Yankees, arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports.</p>
<p>The Boston Red Sox are owned by Fenway Sports Group, which also own Liverpool Football Club of the Premier League in England. The Red Sox are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance, while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance. From May 15, 2003 to April 10, 2013, the Red Sox sold out every home game—a total of 820 games (794 regular season) for a major professional sports record.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox' >More...</a><hr><h2> The Marshall Mathers LP 2</h2><p><i><b>The Marshall Mathers LP 2</b></i> is the upcoming eighth studio album by American hip hop recording artist Eminem, scheduled to be released on November 5, 2013, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. A continuation of Eminem's most acclaimed studio effort, 2000's <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i>, production for the album took place from 2012 to 2013 and was handled by Eminem and other record producers, including Rick Rubin, Dr. Dre, No ID and S1. The album features guest appearances from singers Skylar Grey, Rihanna, and Fun. frontman Nate Ruess, with the only other rapper appearing on the album being Eminem's Aftermath label-mate Kendrick Lamar.</p>
<p>The album title was revealed during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25 with a preview of the lead single "Berzerk", released two days later in the US, peaking at number three on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. It was followed by two singles: "Survival", released on October 8, and "Rap God", released on October 15, 2013. The former debuted at number 17 on the Hot 100, and the latter at number seven. "The Monster", featuring Rihanna, was released as the album's fourth single on October 29, 2013. The album was leaked online on October 30, 2013.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marshall_Mathers_LP_2' >More...</a><hr><h2> Open Source For You</h2><p><i><b>Open Source For You</b></i> (OSFY) (Formerly Linux For You) is Asia's first publication about Linux and Open Source Software.</p>

With a prediction by Urbain Le Verrier, telescopic observations confirming the existence of a major planet were made on the night of September 23–24, 1846, at the Berlin Observatory, by astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle (assisted by Heinrich Louis d'Arrest), working from Le Verrier's calculations. It was a sensational moment of 19th century science and dramatic confirmation of Newtonian gravitational theory. In François Arago's apt phrase, Le Verrier had discovered a planet "with the point of his pen".</p>
<p>In retrospect, after it was discovered it turned out it had been observed many times before but not recognized, and there were others who made various calculations about its location, which did not lead to its observation. By 1846 the planet Uranus had completed nearly one full orbit since its discovery by William Herschel in 1781, and astronomers had detected a series of irregularities in its path which could not be entirely explained by Newton's law of gravitation. These irregularities could, however, be resolved if the gravity of a farther, unknown planet were disturbing its path around the Sun. In 1845 astronomers Urbain Le Verrier in Paris and John Couch Adams in Cambridge separately began calculations to determine the nature and position of such a planet. Unfortunately, Le Verrier's triumph also led to a tense international dispute over priority, as, shortly after the discovery, George Airy, at the time British Astronomer Royal, announced that Adams had also predicted the discovery of the planet. Nevertheless, the Royal Society awarded Le Verrier the Copley medal in 1846 for his achievement, without mention of Adams.</p>
<p>The discovery of Neptune led to the discovery of its moon Triton by William Lassell just seventeen days later.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_Neptune' >More...</a><hr><h2> List of World Series champions</h2><p>The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) and concludes the MLB postseason. First played in 1903, the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the "Fall Classic", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 except in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans, and 1994, when the series was canceled due to the MLB strike.</p>
<p>The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920 and 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches, and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. The winner of the World Series is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States.</p>
<p>109 Series have been contested, with the American League winning 63 and the National League winning 46. The New York Yankees of the American League have played in 40 of the 109 Series through 2013 and have won 27 World Series championships, the most of any Major League franchise. The Yankees have also lost more (13) than any other club. The St. Louis Cardinals, who represented the National League for a 19th time in 2013, have won 11 championships, which is the second-most among Major League teams. The Giants have appeared in the Series 19 times (14 in New York and five in San Francisco for the Giants), which is tied for the most appearances with the St.Louis Cardinals out of all National League teams. However, the Giants have won the Series only seven times, with the 2012 World Series the most recent victory. The Chicago Cubs have the longest streak of not winning the World Series, with their last championship coming in 1908. The Seattle Mariners and the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals are the only current Major League franchises never to have appeared in the World Series; the Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, Colorado Rockies, Washington Senators/Texas Rangers, Tampa Bay Rays, and Seattle Pilots/Milwaukee Brewers have played in the Series but have never won it. The Toronto Blue Jays are the only franchise from outside the United States to appear in a World Series, winning in 1992 and 1993.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Series_champions' >More...</a><hr><h2> David Ortiz</h2><p><b>David Américo Ortiz Arias</b> (born November 18, 1975), nicknamed "<b>Big Papi</b>", "<b>Señor Octubre</b>" and "<b>Cooperstown</b>", is a Dominican-American professional baseball designated hitter (DH) with the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). Ortiz played with the Minnesota Twins from 1997 until 2002.</p>
<p>Ortiz is a nine-time All-Star, a three-time World Series champion and the holder of the Red Sox single-season record for home runs with 54, set during the 2006 season. In 2005, Red Sox ownership presented Ortiz with a plaque proclaiming him "the greatest clutch-hitter in the history of the Boston Red Sox".</p>
<p>Ortiz has hit 431 career home runs, which ranks 45th on the MLB all time home run list.</p>

She is a descendant of the Barrymore family of well-known American stage and cinema actors, and she is the granddaughter of film legend John Barrymore. She first appeared in an advertisement when she was 11 months old. Barrymore made her film debut in <i>Altered States</i> in 1980. Afterwards, she starred in her breakout role as Gertie in Steven Spielberg's <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i>. She quickly became one of Hollywood's most recognized child actresses, going on to establish herself in mainly comic roles.</p>
<p>Following a turbulent childhood which was marked by recurring drug and alcohol abuse and two stints in rehab, Barrymore wrote the 1990 autobiography, <i>Little Girl Lost</i>. She successfully made the transition from child star to adult actress with a number of films including <i>Poison Ivy</i>, <i>Bad Girls</i>, <i>Boys on the Side</i>, and <i>Everyone Says I Love You</i>. Subsequently, she established herself in romantic comedies such as <i>The Wedding Singer</i> and, later, <i>50 First Dates</i>.</p>
<p>In 1997 she and business partner Nancy Juvonen formed the production company Flower Films, with its first production the 1999 Barrymore film <i>Never Been Kissed</i>.

It is celebrated from sunset on 31 October to sunset on 1 November, which is nearly halfway between the autumn equinox and the winter solstice. Along with Imbolc, Beltane and Lughnasadh it makes up the four Gaelic seasonal festivals. It was observed in Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. Kindred festivals were held at the same time of year in other Celtic lands; for example the Brythonic Calan Gaeaf (in Wales), Kalan Gwav (in Cornwall) and Kalan Goañv (in Brittany).</p>
<p>Samhain is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and is known to have pre-Christian roots. Many important events in Irish mythology happen or begin on Samhain. It was the time when cattle were brought back down from the summer pastures and when livestock were slaughtered for the winter. As at Beltane, special bonfires were lit. These were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers and there were rituals involving them. Samhain (like Beltane) was seen as a liminal time, when the spirits or fairies (the Aos Sí) could more easily come into our world. Most scholars see the Aos Sí as remnants of the pagan gods and nature spirits. It was believed that the Aos Sí needed to be propitiated to ensure that the people and their livestock survived the winter. Offerings of food and drink were left for them. The souls of the dead were also thought to revisit their homes. Feasts were had, at which the souls of dead kin were beckoned to attend and a place set at the table for them. Mumming and guising were part of the festival, and involved people going door-to-door in costume (or in disguise), often reciting verses in exchange for food. The costumes may have been a way of imitating, or disguising oneself from, the Aos Sí. Divination rituals were also a big part of the festival and often involved nuts and apples. In the late 19th century, Sir John Rhys and Sir James Frazer suggested that it was the "Celtic New Year", and this view has been repeated by some other scholars.</p>
<p>In the 9th century, the Roman Catholic Church shifted the date of All Saints' Day to 1 November, while 2 November later became All Souls' Day. Over time, Samhain and All Saints'/All Souls' merged and helped to create the modern Halloween. Historians have used the name 'Samhain' to refer to Gaelic 'Halloween' customs up until the 19th century.</p>
<p>Since the latter 20th century, Celtic neopagans and Wiccans have observed Samhain, or something based on it, as a religious holiday. Neopagans in the Southern Hemisphere often celebrate Samhain at the other end of the year (~30 April – 1 May).</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain' >More...</a><hr><h2> Trick-or-treating</h2><p><b>Trick-or-treating</b> or <b>guising</b> is a customary practice for children on Halloween in many countries. Children in costumes travel from house to house in order to ask for treats such as candy (or, in some cultures, money) with the question "Trick or treat?". The "trick" is a (usually idle) threat to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given to them In North America, trick-or-treating has been a customary Halloween tradition since the late 1940s, starting in Anoka, Minnesota. It typically happens between 5:30pm and 9:30pm on October 31, although some municipalities choose other dates. Homeowners wishing to participate in it sometimes decorate their private entrances with artificial spider webs, plastic skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. Some rather reluctant homeowners would simply leave the candy in bowls on the porch, others might be more participative and would even ask an effort from the children in order to provide them with candy. In the more recent years, however, the practice has spread to almost any house within a neighborhood being visited by children, including senior residences and condominiums. The age of trick or treaters is 12 and under.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The tradition of going from door to door receiving food already existed in Great Britain and Ireland in the form of "souling", where children and poor people would sing and say prayers for the dead in return for cakes. Guising—children disguised in costumes going from door to door for food and coins—also predates trick or treat, and is recorded in Scotland at Halloween in 1895, where masqueraders in disguise carrying lanterns made out of scooped out turnips, visit homes to be rewarded with cakes, fruit and money. While going from door to door in disguise has remained popular among Scots and Irish, the North American custom of saying "trick or treat" has recently become common. The activity is prevalent in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Puerto Rico, and northwestern and central Mexico. In the latter, this practice is called <i>calaverita</i> (Spanish for "little skull"), and instead of "trick or treat", the children ask <i>¿me da mi calaverita?</i> ("can you give me my little skull?"); where a calaverita is a small skull made of sugar or chocolate.</p>

It was performed as a Halloween episode of the series on October 30, 1938, and aired over the Columbia Broadcasting System radio network. Directed and narrated by actor and future filmmaker Orson Welles, the episode was an adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel <i>The War of the Worlds</i> (1898).</p>
<p>The first two thirds of the 62-minute broadcast were presented as a series of simulated news bulletins, which suggested to many listeners that an actual alien invasion by Martians was currently in progress. Compounding the issue was the fact that the <i>Mercury Theatre on the Air</i> was a sustaining show (it ran without commercial breaks), adding to the program's realism. Although there were sensationalist accounts in the press about a supposed panic in response to the broadcast, the precise extent of listener response has been debated.</p>
<p>In the days following the adaptation, however, there was widespread outrage and panic by certain listeners, who had believed the events described in the program were real. The program's news-bulletin format was described as cruelly deceptive by some newspapers and public figures, leading to an outcry against the perpetrators of the broadcast. Despite these complaints—or perhaps in part because of them—the episode secured Welles' fame as a dramatist.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_%28radio_drama%29' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-10-31 11:30:08 -0400 -->
