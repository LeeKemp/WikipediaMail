		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 16 March 2014 </h1><h2> UFC 171</h2><p><i><b>UFC 171: Hendricks vs. Lawler</b></i> was a mixed martial arts event held on March 15, 2014 at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_171' >More...</a><hr><h2> David Brenner</h2><p><b>David Norris Brenner</b> (February 4, 1936 – March 15, 2014) was an American comedian, actor and author.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brenner' >More...</a><hr><h2> Starship Troopers (film)</h2><p><i><b>Starship Troopers</b></i> is a 1997 American military science fiction action film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeier, originally from an unrelated script called <i>Bug Hunt at Outpost Nine</i>, but eventually licensing the name <i>Starship Troopers</i>, from a science fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein. It is the only theatrically released film in the <i>Starship Troopers</i> franchise. The film had a budget estimated around $105 million and grossed over $121 million worldwide.</p>
<p>The story follows a young soldier named Johnny Rico and his exploits in the Mobile Infantry, a futuristic military unit. Rico's military career progresses from recruit to non-commissioned officer and finally to officer against the backdrop of an interstellar war between mankind and an insectoid species known as "Arachnids".</p>
<p><i>Starship Troopers</i> was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects at the 70th Academy Awards in 1998. Director Verhoeven says his satirical use of irony and hyperbole is "playing with fascism or fascist imagery to point out certain aspects of American society... of course, the movie is about 'Let's all go to war and let's all die.'"</p>
<p>In 2012, Slant Magazine ranked the film #20 on its list of the 100 Best Films of the 1990s.</p>

Originally released in Japan in 2012, the game was developed by Silicon Studio, best known for the adventure game <i>3D Dot Game Heroes</i>. The game’s job and battle system are similar to <i>Final Fantasy V</i>. It features augmented reality in the gameplay. On April 17, 2013, the game was announced to be released in Europe and Australia in 2013 and North America in 2014, published by Nintendo. An updated version, titled <i><b>Bravely Default: For the Sequel</b></i> (ブレイブリーデフォルト フォーザ・シークウェル, <i>Bureiburī Deforuto: Fōza Shīkuweru</i><sup class="t_nihongo_help noprint">?</sup>), was released in Japan on December 5, 2013. The Western versions of the game are based on the updated version. A full sequel, <i>Bravely Second</i>, was announced in December 2013.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravely_Default' >More...</a><hr><h2> Saint Patrick&#39;s Day</h2><p><b>Saint Patrick</b> (Latin: <i>Patricius</i>; Proto-Irish: <i>*Qatrikias</i>; Modern Irish: <i>Pádraig</i>;<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>needs IPA</i>]</sup> Welsh: <i>Padrig</i>) was a 5th-century Romano-British Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland. Known as the "Apostle of Ireland", he is the primary patron saint of the island along with Saints Brigit and Columba.</p>
<p>The dates of Patrick's life cannot be fixed with certainty but, on a widespread interpretation, he was active as a missionary in Ireland during the second half of the fifth century. He is generally credited with being the first bishop of Armagh, Primate of Ireland.</p>
<p>When he was about 16, he was captured from his home in Great Britain, and taken as a slave to Ireland, where he lived for six years before escaping and returning to his family. After becoming a cleric, he returned to northern and western Ireland. In later life, he served as an ordained bishop, but little is known about the places where he worked. By the seventh century, he had already come to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland.</p>
<p>Saint Patrick's Day is observed on 17 March, the date of his death. It is celebrated inside and outside Ireland as a religious and cultural holiday. In the dioceses of Ireland, it is both a solemnity and a holy day of obligation; it is also a celebration of Ireland itself.</p>

Oxymora appear in a variety of contexts, including inadvertent errors such as <i>ground pilot</i> and literary oxymorons crafted to reveal a paradox.</p>

An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe.</p>
<p>The Chernobyl disaster is widely considered to have been the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event (the maximum classification) on the International Nuclear Event Scale (the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011). The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles. 31 people died during the accident itself, and long-term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for.</p>
