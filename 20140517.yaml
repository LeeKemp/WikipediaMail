  title: Narendra Modi
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Narendra Damodardas Modi</b> ( pronunciation , born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician who is the Prime Minister designate of India, after leading the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a decisive victory in the 2014 Indian general elections. Modi is also the 14th and current Chief Minister of Gujarat, though he is expected to resign soon to take up the office of Prime Minister.</p>
    <p>Modi was a key strategist for the BJP in the successful 1995 and 1998 Gujarat state election campaigns, and was a major campaign figure in the 2009 general elections, eventually won by the Indian National Congress led United Progressive Alliance (UPA). He first became chief minister of Gujarat in October 2001 after the resignation of his predecessor, Keshubhai Patel, and following the defeat of BJP in the by-elections. In July 2007, he became the longest-serving Chief Minister in Gujarat's history, at which point he had been in power for 2,063 days continuously. He is currently serving his fourth consecutive term as Chief Minister.</p>
    <p>Modi is a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and is described as a Hindu nationalist by media, scholars and himself. He is a controversial figure both within India and internationally as his administration has been criticised for the incidents surrounding the 2002 Gujarat riots. He has been praised for his economic policies, which are credited with creating an environment for a high rate of economic growth in Gujarat. However, his administration has also been criticised for failing to make a significant positive impact upon the human development of the state.</p>

  title: Barbara Walters
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Barbara Walters</b> (born September 25, 1929) is an American broadcast journalist, author, and television personality. She has hosted morning television shows <i>Today</i> and <i>The View</i>, the television news magazine <i>20/20</i>, co-anchored the <i>ABC Evening News</i>, and was a contributor to ABC News.</p>
    <p>Walters first became known as a television personality when she was a writer and segment producer of "women's interest stories" on the morning NBC News program <i>The Today Show</i>, where she began work with host Hugh Downs in 1962, once even modeling a swimsuit when an expected model did not show up. Because of her excellent interviewing ability and her popularity with the viewers, and when other women left the program, she was eventually allowed more air time. Even though her production duties made her a significant contributor to the show, she had no input in choosing a successor for Hugh Downs when he left the show in 1971. Frank McGee was hired. Although his salary was twice hers, at Frank McGee's death in 1974, because of a clause added to her contract by her agent (a family friend), she acquired the title "co-host", the first woman by that title for any network news or public affairs program. Jim Hartz became her co-host. Two years later, continuing as a pioneer for women, she became the first female co-anchor of any network evening news, working with Harry Reasoner on the ABC News flagship program <i>ABC Evening News</i> (List of ABC Evening News anchors).</p>
    <p>From 1979 to 2004, Walters worked as co-host and producer for the ABC newsmagazine <i>20/20</i>, again appearing with Hugh Downs. From 1976 to 2010, she contributed as an anchor, reporter, and correspondent for ABC News, along with producing and hosting her own special interview programs several times yearly. Beginning in 1997, she has created, and appears as co-host on, <i>The View</i>. Walters retired from ABC News and as co-host of <i>The View</i> on May 16, 2014.</p>
    <p>In 1996, Walters was ranked #34 on the <i>TV Guide</i> "50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time".</p>

    <p><b>Godzilla</b> (ゴジラ, <i>Gojira</i><sup class="t_nihongo_help noprint">?</sup>) (/ɡɒdˈzɪlə/; [ɡoꜜdʑiɽa]<small class="nowrap"> ( )</small>) is a giant monster or daikaiju originating from a series of tokusatsu films of the same name from Japan. He first appeared in Ishirō Honda's 1954 film <i>Godzilla</i>. Since then, Godzilla has gone on to become a worldwide pop culture icon starring in 28 films produced by Toho Co., Ltd.. The character has appeared in numerous other medium incarnations including video games, novels, comic books, and television series. A 1998 American reimagining was produced by Tri-Star Pictures (the title monster of which was renamed to Zilla by Toho in 2004's <i>Godzilla: Final Wars</i>), while a second American version by Legendary Pictures was released on May 16, 2014. The character is commonly alluded to by the title <b>King of the Monsters</b>, an epithet first used in the Americanized version of Ishiro Honda's original 1954 film.</p>
    <p>With the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the <i>Lucky Dragon 5</i> incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for nuclear weapons. As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones portraying Godzilla as a hero while other plots still portrayed Godzilla as a destructive monster; sometimes the lesser of two threats who plays the defender by default but is still a danger to humanity.</p>

    <p><i><b>Interstellar</b></i> is an upcoming science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine, the film features a team of space travelers who travel through a wormhole. Nolan combined his idea with an existing script by his brother Jonathan Nolan that was developed in 2007 for Paramount Pictures and producer Lynda Obst. Nolan is producing the film with Obst and Emma Thomas.</p>
    <p>Warner Bros., who produced and distributed Nolan's previous films, negotiated with Paramount, traditionally a rival studio, to have a financial stake in <i>Interstellar</i>. Legendary Pictures, which formerly partnered with Warner Bros., also sought a stake. The three studios co-financed the film, and the production companies Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions were enlisted. The director also hired cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema since his previous collaborator Wally Pfister was busy working on <i>Transcendence</i>, his directorial debut. <i>Interstellar</i> is being filmed with a combination of anamorphic 35mm and IMAX film photography. Filming took place in the last quarter of 2013 in locations in the province of Alberta, Canada, in southern Iceland, and in Los Angeles, California.</p>
    <p><i>Interstellar</i> is scheduled to be released on November 7, 2014. Paramount will distribute the film in the United States, and Warner Bros. will distribute the film in other territories.</p>

  title: Computer virus
  extract: |-
    <p>A <b>computer virus</b> is a malware program that, when executed, replicates by inserting copies of itself (possibly modified) into other computer programs, data files, or the boot sector of the hard drive; when this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected". Viruses often perform some type of harmful activity on infected hosts, such as stealing hard disk space or CPU time, accessing private information, corrupting data, displaying political or humorous messages on the user's screen, spamming their contacts, or logging their keystrokes. However, not all viruses carry a destructive payload or attempt to hide themselves—the defining characteristic of viruses is that they are self-replicating computer programs which install themselves without the user's consent.</p>
    <p>Virus writers use social engineering and exploit detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities to gain access to their hosts' computing resources. The vast majority of viruses target systems running Microsoft Windows, employing a variety of mechanisms to infect new hosts, and often using complex anti-detection/stealth strategies to evade antivirus software. Motives for creating viruses can include seeking profit, desire to send a political message, personal amusement, to demonstrate that a vulnerability exists in software, for sabotage and denial of service, or simply because they wish to explore artificial life and evolutionary algorithms.</p>
    <p>Computer viruses currently cause billions of dollars worth of economic damage each year, due to causing systems failure, wasting computer resources, corrupting data, increasing maintenance costs, etc. In response, free, open-source antivirus tools have been developed, and a multi-billion dollar industry of antivirus software vendors has cropped up, selling virus protection to Windows users. Unfortunately, no currently existing antivirus software is able to catch all computer viruses (especially new ones); computer security researchers are actively searching for new ways to enable antivirus solutions to more effectively detect emerging viruses, before they have already become widely distributed.</p>
