		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 08 March 2014 </h1><h2> Malaysia Airlines Flight 370</h2><p><b>Malaysia Airlines Flight 370</b> (MH370, also designated under a codeshare agreement as China Southern Airlines Flight CZ748) is a missing international passenger flight operated by a Boeing 777 aircraft with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board.</p>
<p>Flight 370 departed Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at 00:41 on 8 March 2014 (MST; UTC+8) for a scheduled six-hour flight to Beijing, China. Conflicting reports indicate that Subang Air Traffic Control Centre lost contact with the plane either around 01:22 or 02:40, while it was over the Gulf of Thailand. A joint search-and-rescue effort is being conducted by American, Chinese, Filipino, Malaysian, Singaporean and Vietnamese authorities. If the plane is confirmed to have crashed, this accident would be the deadliest for Malaysia Airlines, the deadliest accident involving a Boeing 777 and the third hull loss of a Boeing 777.<br></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370' >More...</a><hr><h2> Dazzler</h2><p><b>Dazzler</b> (<b>Alison Blaire</b>) is a Marvel Comics superheroine, usually associated with the X-Men. She first appeared in <i>Uncanny X-Men</i> #130 (February 1980).</p>
<p>A mutant with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams, Dazzler was originally developed as a cross-promotional, multi-media creation between Casablanca Records and Marvel Comics until the tie-ins were dropped in 1980. The character was created by a committee of Marvel staff, principally writer/editor Tom DeFalco and illustrator John Romita, Jr.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Dazzler was originally commissioned as a disco singer, the character shifted to other musical genres, including rock and adult contemporary. She starred in a self-titled solo series in the early 1980s which lasted forty-two issues, a Marvel Graphic Novel titled <i>Dazzler: The Movie</i>, a four-issue limited series co-starring The Beast titled <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, and later joined the cast of the X-Men. She was briefly a member of the spin-off group Excalibur but has since re-joined the X-Men. Dazzler was ranked 83rd in <i>Comics Buyer's Guide's</i> "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.</p>

When the vPro brand was launched however (circa 2007), it was mostly identified with AMT, and some journalists today still consider AMT to be the essence of vPro.</p>

He pioneered many techniques in the suspense and psychological thriller genres. After a successful career in British cinema in both silent films and early talkies, renowned as England's best director, Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1939 and became a US citizen in 1955.</p>
<p>Over a career spanning more than half a century, Hitchcock fashioned for himself a distinctive and recognisable directorial style. He pioneered the use of a camera made to move in a way that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism. He framed shots to maximise anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative film editing. His stories often feature fugitives on the run from the law alongside "icy blonde" female characters. Many of Hitchcock's films have twist endings and thrilling plots featuring depictions of violence, murder, and crime. Many of the mysteries, however, are used as decoys or "MacGuffins" that serve the film's themes and the psychological examinations of the characters. Hitchcock's films also borrow many themes from psychoanalysis and feature strong sexual overtones. Through his cameo appearances in his own films, interviews, film trailers, and the television program <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i>, he became a cultural icon.</p>
<p>Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain's <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, which said: "Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else." The magazine <i>MovieMaker</i> has described him as the most influential filmmaker of all time, and he is widely regarded as one of cinema's most significant artists.</p>

It is the world's largest twinjet and has a typical seating capacity for 314 to 451 passengers, with a range of 5,235 to 9,380 nautical miles (9,695 to 17,372 km). Commonly referred to as the "Triple Seven", its distinguishing features include the largest-diameter turbofan engines of any aircraft, six wheels on each main landing gear, a circular fuselage cross-section, and a blade-shaped tail cone. Developed in consultation with eight major airlines, the 777 was designed to replace older wide-body airliners and bridge the capacity difference between the 767 and 747. As Boeing's first fly-by-wire airliner, it has computer-mediated controls; it is also the first entirely computer-designed commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>As of 2013<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup>, the 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths. The original 777-200 variant entered commercial service in 1995, followed by the extended-range 777-200ER in 1997. The stretched 777-300, which is 33.3 ft (10.1 m) longer, entered service in 1998. The longer-range 777-300ER and 777-200LR variants entered service in 2004 and 2006 respectively, while a freighter version, the 777F, debuted in February 2009. Both longer-range versions and the freighter feature General Electric GE90 engines and extended raked wingtips. The earlier 777-200, −200ER and −300 versions are equipped with GE90, Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 or Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. The 777-200LR is the world's longest-range airliner and can fly more than halfway around the globe; it holds the record for the longest distance flown non-stop by a commercial aircraft. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of upgraded 777-8X and 777-9X models featuring composite wings and GE9X engines.</p>
<p>United Airlines first placed the 777 into commercial airline service in June 1995. As of June 2013, 60 customers had placed orders for 1,452 aircraft of all variants, with 1,113 delivered. The most common and successful variant is the 777-300ER with 452 delivered and over 700 orders as of December 2013. Emirates operates the largest 777 fleet, with 127 passenger and freighter aircraft as of June 2013. The airliner is rated as one of the safest aircraft based on its accident safety record and high number of flight hours. The 777 has been involved in four hull-loss accidents as of March 2014; Asiana Airlines Flight 214 was the first fatal crash of the aircraft in 18 years of revenue service.</p>
<p>The 777 ranks as one of Boeing's best-selling models. Because of rising fuel costs, airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the Airbus A330-300, upcoming Airbus A350 XWB, and the out-of-production A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11. The 787 Dreamliner, which entered service in 2011, shares design features with the 777. The updated 777X, currently in development, further includes technologies used on the 787.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777' >More...</a><hr><h2> International Women's Day</h2><p><b>International Women's Day</b> (<b>IWD</b>), also called <b>International Working Women's Day</b>, is marked on <b>March 8</b> every year. In different regions the focus of the celebrations ranges from general celebration of respect, appreciation and love towards women to a celebration for women's economic, political, and social achievements. Started as a Socialist political event, the holiday blended in the culture of many countries, primarily in Europe, including Russia. In some regions, the day lost its political flavor, and became simply an occasion for men to express their love for women in a way somewhat similar to a mixture of Mother's Day and Valentine's Day. In other regions, however, the political and human rights theme designated by the United Nations runs strong, and political and social awareness of the struggles of women worldwide are brought out and examined in a hopeful manner. This is a day which some people celebrate by wearing purple ribbons.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women%27s_Day' >More...</a><hr><h2> Air France Flight 447</h2><p><b>Air France Flight 447</b> (abbreviated <b>AF447</b>) was a scheduled commercial flight from Galeão International Airport in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris, France. On 1 June 2009, the Airbus A330-203 airliner serving the flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in the deaths of all 216 passengers and 12 aircrew. The accident was the deadliest in the history of Air France. It was also the Airbus A330's second and deadliest fatal accident, and its first while in commercial passenger service.</p>
<p>Initial investigation was hampered because authorities were unable to locate the wreckage; it was located nearly two years after the accident, and the aircraft's black boxes were finally recovered from the ocean floor in May 2011. The final report, released at a news conference on 5 July 2012, stated that the aircraft crashed after temporary inconsistencies between the airspeed measurements—likely due to the aircraft's pitot tubes being obstructed by ice crystals—caused the autopilot to disconnect, after which the crew reacted incorrectly and ultimately led the aircraft to an aerodynamic stall from which they did not recover.</p>
