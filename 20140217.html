		<h1>Popular Pages - Monday 17 February 2014 </h1><h2> Kong (dog toy)</h2><p><b>Kong</b> (sometimes KONG) is a popular line of dog toys and cat toys introduced in 1976. The classic Kong resembles a snowman-like structure of three balls pushed together. Kongs also come in several variations for dogs of different ages and sizes. Made of rubber, they are hollow in the middle, and can be stuffed with treats or frozen to provide long-lasting distraction for anxious or high-energy dogs.</p>
<p>They come in four rubber types; red for average chewers, pink or blue for puppies, purple for seniors, and black for tough chewers. In addition to the typical snowman-like Kongs, Kong has also made a very successful<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> line of dental chews, balls, pull toys (such as the Kong Wubba and the Kong Tugger Knots), Frisbees, a dog binky, floating toys, squeakers, and various interactive toys and accessories. For cats, Kong also has a line of toys including a cat version of their "Wubba", as well as scratching boards, catnip, and other chew toys.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong_(dog_toy)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Bode Miller</h2><p><b>Samuel Bode Miller</b> (/ˈboʊdiː/; born October 12, 1977) is a World Cup alpine ski racer from the United States.</p>
<p>He is an Olympic and World Championship gold medalist, a two-time overall World Cup champion in 2005 and 2008, and the most successful male American alpine ski racer of all time. He is also considered one of the greatest World Cup racers of all time with 33 victories - one of five men to win World Cup events in all five disciplines. In November 2004, Miller became the 5th and last man to win World Cup races in the slalom, giant slalom, Super-G, downhill, and combined − and today he is the only skiier with five or more victories in each discipline. In 2008, Miller and Lindsey Vonn won the overall World Cup titles for the first U.S. sweep in 25 years.</p>
<p>He has won six medals in the Winter Olympics, the most of any U.S. skier − two silvers (giant slalom and combined) in Salt Lake City 2002, a gold (super combined), a silver (Super-G) and a bronze (downhill) in Vancouver 2010 and a bronze (Super-G) in Sochi 2014 . Miller is one of 5 skiers who have won Olympic medals in 4 different disciplines, matching the feats of Kjetil André Aamodt and female racers Anja Pärson, Janica Kostelić, and Katja Seizinger.</p>
<p>He has won six discipline World Cup titles. During his career Miller has also won four World Championships titles in four different disciplines (giant slalom, combined, Super-G and downhill) and one silver medal in Super-G .</p>

<p>According to old European beliefs, a candle made of the fat from a malefactor who died on the gallows, lighted, and placed (as if in a candlestick) in the Hand of Glory, which comes from the same man as the fat in the candle; this would have rendered motionless all persons to whom it was presented. The candle could only be put out with milk. In another version, the hair of the dead man is used as a wick, and the candle would give light only to the holder. The Hand of Glory also purportedly had the power to unlock any door it came across. The method of making a Hand of Glory is described in <i>Petit Albert</i>, and in the <i>Compendium Maleficarum</i>.</p>
<p>Etymologist Walter Skeat reports that, while folklore has long attributed mystical powers to a dead man's hand, the specific phrase "Hand of Glory" is in fact a folk etymology: it derives from the French <i>main de gloire</i>, a corruption of <i>mandragore</i>, which is to say mandrake. Skeat writes, "The identification of the <i>hand of glory</i> with the <i>mandrake</i> is clinched by the statement in Cockayne's Leechdoms, i. 245, that the mandrake "shineth by night altogether like a lamp" (Cockayne in turn is quoting <i>Pseudo-Apuleius</i>, in a translation of a Saxon manuscript of his <i>Herbarium</i>)</p>
<p>Whitby Museum in North Yorkshire, England possesses a Hand of Glory.</p>

With partner Charlie White, she is a two-time (2011, 2013) World champion, the 2010 Olympic silver medalist, two-time (2010, 2012) World silver medalist, five-time Grand Prix Final champion (2009–2013), three-time Four Continents champion (2009, 2011, 2013) and six-time U.S. national champion (2009–2014).

An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe.</p>
<p>The Chernobyl disaster is widely considered to have been the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event (the maximum classification) on the International Nuclear Event Scale (the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011). The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles. The official Soviet casualty count of 31 deaths has been disputed, and long-term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for. </p>
