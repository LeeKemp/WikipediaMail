		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 02 February 2014 </h1><h2> John Swartzwelder</h2><p><b>John Swartzwelder</b> (born November 16, 1950) is an American comedy writer and novelist, best known for his work on the animated television series <i>The Simpsons</i>, as well as a number of novels. He is credited with writing the largest number of <i>Simpsons</i> episodes (59 full episodes, with contributions to several others) by a large margin. Swartzwelder was one of several writers recruited to <i>The Simpsons</i> from the pages of George Meyer's <i>Army Man</i> magazine.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swartzwelder' >More...</a><hr><h2> Woody Allen</h2><p><b>Woody Allen</b> (born <b>Allen Stewart Konigsberg</b>, December 1, 1935) is an American screenwriter, director, actor, comedian, author, playwright, and musician whose career spans more than 50 years.</p>
<p>He worked as a comedy writer in the 1950s, writing jokes and scripts for television and publishing several books of short humor pieces. In the early 1960s, Allen began performing as a stand-up comic, emphasizing monologues rather than traditional jokes. As a comic, he developed the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful nebbish, which he insists is quite different from his real-life personality. In 2004, Comedy Central ranked Allen in fourth place on a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics, while a UK survey ranked Allen as the third greatest comedian.</p>
<p>By the mid-1960s Allen was writing and directing films, first specializing in slapstick comedies before moving into dramatic material influenced by European art cinema during the 1970s. He is often identified as part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmakers of the mid-1960s to late '70s. Allen often stars in his films, typically in the persona he developed as a standup. Some best-known of his over 40 films are <i>Annie Hall</i> (1977), <i>Manhattan</i> (1979), <i>Hannah and Her Sisters</i> (1986), and <i>Midnight in Paris</i> (2011). Critic Roger Ebert described Allen as "a treasure of the cinema."</p>
<p>Allen has been nominated 24 times and won four Academy Awards: three for Best Original Screenplay and one for Best Director (<i>Annie Hall</i>). He has more screenwriting Academy Award nominations than any other writer. He has won nine British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards. Allen performs regularly as a jazz clarinetist at small venues in Manhattan. In 2011, PBS televised the film biography, <i>Woody Allen: A Documentary</i>, on the <i>American Masters</i> TV series, covering biographies of actors and writers who have had a profound impact on the nation's popular culture.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen' >More...</a><hr><h2> Groundhog Day</h2><p><b>Groundhog Day</b> (Pennsylvania German: <i>Grundsaudaag</i>, <i>Murmeltiertag</i>) is a day celebrated on February 2. According to folklore, if it is cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day, then spring will come early; if it is sunny, the groundhog will supposedly see its shadow and retreat back into its burrow, and the winter weather will continue for six more weeks.</p>
<p>Modern customs of the holiday involve celebrations where early morning festivals are held to watch the groundhog emerging from its burrow.</p>
<p>In southeastern Pennsylvania, Groundhog Lodges (<i>Grundsow Lodges</i>) celebrate the holiday with <i>fersommlinge</i>, social events in which food is served, speeches are made, and one or more <i>g'spiel</i> (plays or skits) are performed for entertainment. The Pennsylvania German dialect is the only language spoken at the event, and those who speak English pay a penalty, usually in the form of a nickel, dime, or quarter per word spoken, with the money put into a bowl in the center of the table.</p>
<p>The largest Groundhog Day celebration is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania with Punxsutawney Phil. Groundhog Day, already a widely recognized and popular tradition, received widespread attention as a result of the 1993 film <i>Groundhog Day</i>.</p>

Butler. In them, Butler frankly discusses from his experience as a career military officer how business interests commercially benefit from warfare.</p>
<p>After his retirement from the Marine Corps, Butler made a nationwide tour in the early 1930s giving his speech "War is a Racket". The speech was so well received that he wrote a longer version as a small book with the same title that was published in 1935 by Round Table Press, Inc., of New York. The booklet was also condensed in <i>Reader's Digest</i> as a book supplement which helped popularize his message. In an introduction to the <i>Reader's Digest</i> version, Lowell Thomas, the "as told to" author of Butler's oral autobiographical adventures, praised Butler's "moral as well as physical courage".</p>

He achieved fame after winning the Academy Award for Best Actor in the U.S. film, <i>Judgment at Nuremberg</i> in 1961.</p>
<p>Schell, whose parents were involved in the arts, grew up surrounded by acting and literature. While he was a child, his family was forced to flee Vienna in 1938 when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany, and they settled in Zurich, Switzerland. After World War II ended, Schell took up acting or directing full time. He appeared in numerous German films, often anti-war, before moving on to Hollywood.</p>
<p>He was top billed in a number of Nazi-era themed films, as he could speak both English and German. Among those were two films for which he was Oscar nominated as best actor: <i>The Man in the Glass Booth</i> (1975), where he played a character with two identities, and <i>Julia</i> (1977), where he helps the underground in Nazi Germany. His range of acting went beyond German characters, however, and during his career, he also played personalities as diverse as Venezuelan leader Simón Bolívar, Russian emperor Peter the Great, and scientist Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>In his private life, he was an accomplished pianist. His sister, Maria Schell, was also a noted Hollywood actress.</p>

<p>Rollins' management clients also included Robert Klein and David Letterman. Joffe focused more on Allen, with Rollins focusing on others.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Rollins_(producer)' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2014-02-02 11:30:10 -0500 -->
