Her talents earned her a place in the 1982 edition of The Guinness Book of World Records.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuntala_Devi' >More...</a><hr><h2> List of shortest people</h2><p>This <b>list of shortest people</b> includes people who have been described or claimed as "shortest" in their lifetime or profession.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shortest_people' >More...</a><hr><h2> Sojourner Truth</h2><p><b>Sojourner Truth</b> (/soʊˈdʒɜrnər ˈtruːθ/; <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 1797 – November 26, 1883) was the self-given name, from 1843 onward, of <b>Isabella Baumfree</b>, an African-American abolitionist and women's rights activist. Truth was born into slavery in Swartekill, Ulster County, New York, but escaped with her infant daughter to freedom in 1826. After going to court to recover her son, she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man. Her best-known extemporaneous speech on gender inequalities, "Ain't I a Woman?", was delivered in 1851 at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. During the Civil War, Truth helped recruit black troops for the Union Army; after the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure land grants from the federal government for former slaves.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_Truth' >More...</a><hr><h2> Usage share of operating systems</h2><p>The <b>usage share of operating systems</b> is the percentage market share of the operating systems used in computers. Different categories of computers use a wide variety of operating systems, so the total usage share varies enormously from one category to another.</p>
<p>In certain categories, one family of operating systems dominates, for example, most desktop and laptop computers use Microsoft Windows, while most supercomputers use Linux. In other categories, such as smartphones and servers, there is more diversity and competition.</p>
<p>Data about operating system share is difficult to obtain, since in most of the categories below there are no reliable primary sources or agreed methodologies for its collection. Data for both mobile and desktop operating systems can be seen on the right, using information from Net Applications.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems' >More...</a><hr><h2> Lithuanian people</h2><p><b>Lithuanians</b> (Lithuanian: <i>lietuviai</i>, singular <i>lietuvis/lietuvė</i>) are the Baltic ethnic group native to Lithuania, where they number around 2,561,300 people. Another million or more make up the Lithuanian diaspora, largely found in countries such as the United States, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Russia, United Kingdom and Ireland. Their native language is Lithuanian, one of only two surviving members of the Baltic language family. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population of Lithuania proper identified themselves as Lithuanians, 6.74% as Poles, 6.31% as Russians, 1.23% as Belarusians, and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups. Most Lithuanians belong to the Roman Catholic Church, while the Lietuvininkai who lived in the northern part of East Prussia prior to World War II, were mostly Evangelical Lutherans.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_people' >More...</a><hr><h2> Namaste</h2><p><i><b>Namaste</b></i> (/ˈnɑːməsteɪ/ <i><b>NAH</b>-məs-tay</i>; <small>Hindi: </small>[nəməsteː]<small class="nowrap"> ( listen)</small>; Devanagari: नमस्ते; formal<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup>: <b>Namaskar</b>/<b>Namaskaram</b>) is a common spoken valediction or salutation originating in the Indian Subcontinent. It is a customary greeting when individuals meet, and a valediction upon their parting. A non-contact form<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> of salutation is traditionally preferred in India<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> and Nepal; Namaste is the most common form of such a salutation.</p>
<p>When spoken to another person, it is commonly accompanied by a slight bow made with hands pressed together, palms touching and fingers pointed upwards, in front of the chest. This gesture, called <i>Añjali Mudrā</i> or <i>Pranamasana</i>, can also be performed wordlessly and carries the same meaning.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste' >More...</a><hr><h2> Tunguska event</h2><p>Coordinates: 60°55′N 101°57′E</p>
<p>The <b>Tunguska event</b> was an enormously powerful explosion that occurred near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in what is now Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia, at about 07:14 KRAT (00:14 UT) on June 30 <small>[O.S. June 17]</small>, 1908. The explosion, having the epicentre (60.886°N, 101.894°E), is believed to have been caused by the air burst of a small asteroid or comet at an altitude of 5–10 kilometres (3–6 mi) above Earth's surface. Different studies have yielded widely varying estimates of the object's size, on the order of 60 m (200 ft) to 190 m (620 ft). It is the largest impact event on or near Earth in recorded history. (It is classified as an impact even though the asteroid or comet is believed to have burst in the air rather than hitting the surface.)</p>
<p>Since the 1908 explosion, there have been an estimated 1,000 scholarly papers (mainly in Russian) published on the problem of the Tunguska explosion. Many scientists have participated in Tunguska studies; the best known are Leonid Kulik, Yevgeny Krinov, Kirill Florensky, Nikolai Vladimirovich Vasiliev, and Wilhelm Fast. In 2013, a team of researchers led by Victor Kvasnytsya of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine published analysis results of micro-samples from a peat bog near the blast epicenter showing fragments that may be of meteoric origin.</p>
<p>Estimates of the energy of the blast range from as low as three to as high as 30 megatons of TNT (between 13 and 130 PJ). (Most likely it was between 10–15 megatons of TNT (42–63 PJ).) The energy of the explosion was about 1,000 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan; roughly equal to that of the United States' Castle Bravo ground-based thermonuclear test detonation on March 1, 1954; and about two-fifths that of the Soviet Union's later Tsar Bomba (the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated).</p>
<p>It is estimated that the Tunguska explosion knocked down some 80 million trees over an area of 2,150 square kilometres (830 sq mi), and that the shock wave from the blast would have measured 5.0 on the Richter scale. An explosion of this magnitude is capable of destroying a large metropolitan area. This possibility has helped to spark discussion of asteroid deflection strategies.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event' >More...</a><hr><h2> Gary Kubiak</h2><p><b>Gary Wayne Kubiak</b> (born August 15, 1961) is the head coach for the Houston Texans of the National Football League. Kubiak has participated in six Super Bowls, losing three as a player with the Denver Broncos and winning three as an assistant coach with Denver and the San Francisco 49ers.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kubiak' >More...</a><hr><h2> UTA Flight 772</h2><p><b>UTA Flight 772</b> of the French airline Union des Transports Aériens was a scheduled flight operating from Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo, via N'Djamena in Chad, to Paris CDG airport in France.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, 19 September 1989 the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aircraft registered N54629 took off from N'Djamena International Airport at 13:13. 46 minutes later, at its cruising altitude of 10,700 metres (35,100 ft), an explosion caused UTA Flight 772 to break up over the Sahara Desert near the towns of Bilma and Ténéré in Niger. All 155 passengers and 15 crew members died.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTA_Flight_772' >More...</a><hr><h2> Case Keenum</h2><p><b>Casey Austin "Case" Keenum</b> (born February 17, 1988) is an American football quarterback for the Houston Texans of the National Football League (NFL). Keenum is the NCAA's all-time leader in total passing yards, touchdowns, and completions. On October 22, 2011, Keenum became the Football Bowl Subdivision's all-time leader in total offense. On October 27, 2011, Keenum became the all-time leader in total touchdown passes by an FBS quarterback. During that game he threw for nine touchdowns and 534 yards.</p>
<p>In the 2008 college football season, Keenum ranked first nationally in total offense and second in total passing yards. As a result of his on-field contributions to Houston's success, Keenum was named to several All-American lists. He is the only quarterback in Division I FBS football history to have passed for more than 5,000 yards in each of three seasons.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Keenum' >More...</a><hr><h2> Richie Incognito</h2><p><b>Richard Dominick Incognito, Jr.</b> (born July 5, 1983) is an American football guard for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He is currently "indefinitely suspended" by the team for alleged misconduct. He played college football for the University of Nebraska. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Incognito has also played for the Buffalo Bills.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Incognito' >More...</a><hr><h2> University of Mississippi</h2><p><b>The University of Mississippi</b> (colloquially known as <b>Ole Miss</b>) is a public, coeducational research university in Oxford, Mississippi, United States. Founded in 1848, the school is composed of the main campus in Oxford, four branch campuses located in Booneville, Grenada, Tupelo, and Southaven, as well as the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. It also operates the University of Mississippi Field Station in Abbeville. It is both a sea-grant and space-grant institute.

Ole Miss is Mississippi's largest university with a total enrollment of 21,528 in fall 2012. The Oxford campus is the second-largest main campus in the state with a fall 2012 enrollment of 17,142.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mississippi' >More...</a><hr><h2> Phoolan Devi</h2><p><b>Phoolan Devi</b> (10 August 1963 – 25 July 2001), popularly known as the "Bandit Queen", was an Indian dacoit (armed bandit), and later a politician.</p>
<p>Phoolan was born in rural India, in a poor family belonging to the Mallaah caste. Married to a much older man at an early age, she was branded as a social outcast after she left her husband to escape marital mistreatment. A family feud resulted in her arrest and made her a victim of police brutality, which greatly embittered her. She was kidnapped by a gang of bandits, who had been paid to kill her. Subsequently, she married one of them, Vikram Mallah, who protected her from a rape attempt by the gang leader, and became part of the gang. With Vikram as the new leader of the gang, the group punished Phoolan's ex-husband, and carried out several robberies. Later, a group of bandits belonging to the Thakur caste murdered Vikram and gang-raped Phoolan. After escaping from their captivity, she raised a Mallah-dominated gang, which carried out a series of violent robberies. In 1981, her gang raided the Thakur village where she killed 22 Thakur men in what came to be known as the Behmai massacre.</p>
<p>She gained a fearsome reputation as the "Bandit Queen", and some villagers started calling her an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Durga. Some people saw her violence as the lower castes' retaliation against the cruelty of the upper-castes. In 1983, she surrendered and was tried for complicity in over 30 instances of murder and numerous other crimes. She spent 11 years in prison while her trial was pending. The 1994 film <i>Bandit Queen</i>, made against her will, was based on her life. Subsequently, the Samajwadi Party's state government withdrew all cases against her. After her release, she contested elections as a candidate of the Samajwadi Party, and was elected to parliament in 1996. On July 25th 2001, she was shot dead outside her home by masked men claiming to seek revenge for the Behmai massacre.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoolan_Devi' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-11-04 11:30:07 -0500 -->
