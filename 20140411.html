		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 11 April 2014 </h1><h2> Hannah Montana</h2><p><i><b>Hannah Montana</b></i>, also known as <i><b>Hannah Montana Forever</b></i> for the fourth season, is an American musical comedy series created by Michael Poryes, Rich Correll, and Barry O'Brien which focused on Miley Stewart (portrayed by Miley Cyrus), a teenager living a double life as an average schoolgirl by day and a famous recording artist Hannah Montana by night. It follows the day-to-day life of Miley, her brother and friends while also starring Cyrus' country singer father Billy Ray Cyrus as her dad.</p>
<p>The series, produced by It's a Laugh Productions and Michael Poryes Productions, premiered on Disney Channel on March 24, 2006 and concluded on January 16, 2011 after airing four seasons and ninety-eight episodes. The soundtrack albums <i>Hannah Montana</i> (2006), <i>Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus</i> (2007), <i>Hannah Montana 3</i> (2009), and <i>Hannah Montana Forever</i> (2010) were released to coincide with their respective seasons. In 2007, the series' success led to the Best of Both Worlds Tour, which visited North America. The following year, it was adapted into the 3D film <i>Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert</i> and its accompanying <i>soundtrack</i>. In 2009, the series' first feature film <i>Hannah Montana: The Movie</i> was released to commercial success, and was additionally promoted through its accompanying soundtrack. The show has additionally distributed all seasons to DVD.</p>
<p>The series received generally favorable reviews from critics, and has been recognized as a "guilty pleasure" by several media outlets. The show's instant success is widely credited with the launch of Cyrus' career and her establishment as a teen idol. However, as she continued to develop an increasingly provocative image as the series progressed, the series has received criticism for appearing to be a negative influence on its younger audience.</p>

He was the first to synthesize the natural product physostigmine, and a pioneer in the industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones progesterone and testosterone from plant sterols such as stigmasterol and sitosterol. His work laid the foundation for the steroid drug industry's production of cortisone, other corticosteroids, and birth control pills.</p>
<p>He later started his own company to synthesize steroid intermediates from the Mexican wild yam. His work helped greatly reduce the cost of steroid intermediates to large multinational pharmaceutical companies, helping to significantly expand the use of several important drugs.</p>
<p>Julian received more than 130 chemical patents. He was one of the first African-Americans to receive a doctorate in chemistry. He was the first African-American chemist inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the second African-American scientist inducted from any field.</p>

Just as the surface of the cube consists of 6 square faces, the hypersurface of the tesseract consists of 8 cubical cells. The tesseract is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes.</p>
<p>A generalization of the cube to dimensions greater than three is called a "hypercube", "<i>n</i>-cube" or "measure polytope". The tesseract is the <b>four-dimensional hypercube</b>, or <b>4-cube</b>.</p>
<p>According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the word <i>tesseract</i> was coined and first used in 1888 by Charles Howard Hinton in his book <i>A New Era of Thought</i>, from the Greek τέσσερεις ακτίνες ("four rays"), referring to the four lines from each vertex to other vertices. In this publication, as well as some of Hinton's later work, the word was occasionally spelled "tessaract." Some people<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> have called the same figure a <b>tetracube</b>, and also simply a <b>hypercube</b> (although a <i>tetracube</i> can also mean a polycube made of four cubes, and the term <i>hypercube</i> is also used with dimensions greater than 4).</p>

He is the host of Comedy Central's <i>The Colbert Report</i>, a satirical news show in which Colbert portrays a caricatured version of conservative political pundits. On April 10, 2014, Colbert was chosen to succeed David Letterman as the host of the <i>Late Show</i> on CBS after Letterman retires in 2015.</p>
<p>Colbert originally studied to be an actor, but became interested in improvisational theatre when he met famed Second City director Del Close while attending Northwestern University. He first performed professionally as an understudy for Steve Carell at Second City Chicago; among his troupe mates were comedians Paul Dinello and Amy Sedaris, with whom he developed the sketch comedy series <i>Exit 57</i>.</p>
<p>Colbert also wrote and performed on the short-lived <i>Dana Carvey Show</i> before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series <i>Strangers with Candy</i>. He gained considerable attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher Chuck Noblet. His work as a correspondent on Comedy Central's news-parody series <i>The Daily Show</i> first introduced him to a wide audience.</p>
<p>In 2005, he left <i>The Daily Show</i> to host a spin-off series, <i>The Colbert Report</i>. Following <i>The Daily Show</i>'s news-parody concept, <i>The Colbert Report</i> is a parody of personality-driven political opinion shows such as <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>. Since its debut, the series has established itself as one of Comedy Central's highest-rated series, earning Colbert three Emmy Award nominations and an invitation to perform as featured entertainer at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in 2006. Colbert was named one of <i>Time</i>'s 100 most influential people in 2006 and 2012. His book <i>I Am America (And So Can You!)</i> was number one on <i>The New York Times</i> Best Seller list.</p>

Unlike Mother's Day and Father's Day, it is not federally recognized, though the Siblings Day Foundation is working to change this. Since 1998, the governors of 39 states have officially issued proclamations to recognize Siblings Day in their state.</p>

From 1995 until 2005, he was the Member of Provincial Parliament for Whitby—Ajax, and a member of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party caucus and unsuccessfully sought the leadership of the provincial party on two occasions.</p>
<p>Flaherty won the riding of Whitby—Oshawa in the federal election held January 23, 2006 as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada narrowly beating Liberal incumbent Judi Longfield. He was re-elected in 2008 and 2011. Flaherty's widow, Christine Elliott, represents Whitby—Oshawa in the Ontario legislature.</p>

It is the simplest of the alkylsulfonic acids. Salts and esters of methanesulfonic acid are known as mesylates. Methanesulfonic acid is used as an acid catalyst in organic reactions because it is a non-volatile, strong acid that is soluble in organic solvents. Methanesulfonic acid is convenient for industrial applications because it is liquid at ambient temperature, while the closely related <i>p</i>-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) is solid. However, in a laboratory setting, solid PTSA is more convenient.</p>
<p>Methanesulfonic acid may be considered an intermediate compound between sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), and methylsulfonylmethane ((CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>), effectively replacing an -OH group with a -CH<sub>3</sub> group at each step. This pattern can extend no further in either direction without breaking down the -SO<sub>2</sub> group.</p>
<p>Methanesulfonic acid can be used in the generation of borane (BH<sub>3</sub>). By reacting methanesulfonic acid with NaBH<sub>4</sub> in an aprotic solvent such as THF or DMS, the complex of BH<sub>3</sub> and the solvent is formed.</p>

The word  "tickle"  evolved from the Middle English <i>tikelen</i>, perhaps frequentative of <i>ticken</i>, to touch lightly. The idiom <i>tickled pink</i> means to be pleased or delighted.</p>
<p>In 1897, psychologists G. Stanley Hall and Arthur Allin described a "tickle" as two different types of phenomena. One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type of tickle, called a knismesis, generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation. Another type of tickle is the laughter inducing "heavy" tickle, produced by repeatedly applying pressure to "ticklish" areas, and is known as gargalesis. Such sensations can be pleasurable or exciting, but are sometimes considered highly unpleasant, particularly in the case of relentless heavy tickling.</p>
<p>The question as to why a person could not tickle him/herself was raised by the Greek philosopher, Aristotle.</p>
<p>Francis Bacon and Charles Darwin believe that humorous laughter requires a "light" frame of mind. But they differed on ticklish laughter: Darwin thought that the same light state of mind was required, whereas Bacon said no: When tickled, noted Bacon, "men even in a grieved state of mind, yet cannot sometimes forbear laughing."</p>

</ul><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed_bug' >More...</a><hr><h2> Lilith</h2><p><b>Lilith</b> (Hebrew: לילית‎; <i>lilit</i>, or <i>lilith</i>) is a Hebrew name for a figure in Jewish mythology, developed earliest in the Babylonian Talmud, who is generally thought to be in part derived from a class of female demons <i>Līlīṯu</i> in Mesopotamian texts of Assyria and Babylonia.</p>
<p>Evidence in later Jewish materials is plentiful, but little information has been found relating to the original Akkadian and Babylonian view of these demons. The relevance of two sources previously used to connect the Jewish Lilith to an Akkadian Lilitu—the Gilgamesh appendix and the Arslan Tash amulets—are now both disputed by recent scholarship. The two problematic sources are discussed below.</p>
<p>The Hebrew term <i>Lilith</i> or "Lilit" (translated as "Night creatures", "night monster", "night hag", or "screech owl") first occurs in Isaiah 34:14, either singular or plural according to variations in the earliest manuscripts, though in a list of animals. In the Dead Sea Scrolls <i>Songs of the Sage</i> the term first occurs in a list of monsters. In Jewish magical inscriptions on bowls and amulets from the 6th century CE onwards, Lilith is identified as a female demon and the first visual depictions appear.</p>
<p>In Jewish folklore, from the 8th–10th century <i>Alphabet of Ben Sira</i> onwards, Lilith becomes Adam's first wife, who was created at the same time (Rosh Hashanah) and from the same earth as Adam. This contrasts with Eve, who was created from one of Adam's ribs. The legend was greatly developed during the Middle Ages, in the tradition of Aggadic midrashim, the Zohar, and Jewish mysticism. In the 13th century writings of Rabbi Isaac ben Jacob ha-Cohen, for example, Lilith left Adam after she refused to become subservient to him and then would not return to the Garden of Eden after she mated with archangel Samael. The resulting Lilith legend is still commonly used as source material in modern Western culture, literature, occultism, fantasy, and horror.</p>
