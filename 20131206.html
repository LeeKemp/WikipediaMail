		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 06 December 2013 </h1><h2> Nelson Mandela</h2><p><b>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela</b> (<small>Xhosa pronunciation: </small>[xoˈliːɬaɬa manˈdeːla]) (18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary as well as a politician and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the first black South African to hold the office, and the first elected in a fully representative election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid through tackling institutionalised racism, poverty and inequality, and fostering racial reconciliation. Politically an African nationalist and democratic socialist, he served as the President of the African National Congress (ANC) from 1991 to 1997. Internationally, Mandela was the Secretary General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999.</p>
<p>A Xhosa born to the Thembu royal family, Mandela attended the Fort Hare University and the University of Witwatersrand, where he studied law. Living in Johannesburg, he became involved in anti-colonial politics, joining the ANC and becoming a founding member of its Youth League. After the South African National Party came to power in 1948, he rose to prominence in the ANC's 1952 Defiance Campaign, was appointed superintendent of the organisation's Transvaal chapter and presided over the 1955 Congress of the People. Working as a lawyer, he was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and, with the ANC leadership, was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the Treason Trial from 1956 to 1961. Although initially committed to non-violent protest, he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) in 1961 in association with the South African Communist Party, leading a sabotage campaign against the apartheid government. In 1962 he was arrested, convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the government, and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial.</p>
<p>Mandela served 27 years in prison, initially on Robben Island, and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. An international campaign lobbied for his release, which was granted in 1990 amid escalating civil strife. Mandela published his autobiography and opened negotiations with President F.W. de Klerk to abolish apartheid and establish multiracial elections in 1994, in which he led the ANC to victory. As South Africa's first black president Mandela formed a Government of National Unity in an attempt to defuse racial tension. He also promulgated a new constitution and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Continuing the former government's liberal economic policy, his administration introduced measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator between Libya and the United Kingdom in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial, and oversaw military intervention in Lesotho. He declined to run for a second term, and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela subsequently became an elder statesman, focusing on charitable work in combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the Nelson Mandela Foundation.</p>
<p>Although Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life, he became widely popular following his release. Despite critics who continued to denounce him as a communist sympathiser and terrorist, he gained international acclaim for his activism, having received more than 250 honours, including the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Soviet Order of Lenin. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, <b>Madiba</b>, or as <b>Tata</b> ("Father"); he is often described as "the father of the nation".</p>

Despite the origin of the name, "ringing" is but one of many sounds the person may perceive.</p>
<p>Tinnitus is not a disease, but a condition that can result from a wide range of underlying causes: neurological damage (multiple sclerosis), ear infections, oxidative stress, foreign objects in the ear, nasal allergies that prevent (or induce) fluid drain, wax build-up, and exposure to loud sounds. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines may cause tinnitus as well. Tinnitus may be an accompaniment of sensorineural hearing loss or congenital hearing loss, or it may be observed as a side effect of certain medications (ototoxic tinnitus). However, the most common cause is noise-induced hearing loss.</p>
<p>As tinnitus is usually a subjective phenomenon, it is difficult to measure using objective tests, such as by comparison with noise of known frequency and intensity, as in an audiometric test. The condition is often rated clinically on a simple scale from "slight" to "catastrophic" according to the practical difficulties it imposes, such as interference with sleep, quiet activities, and normal daily activities.</p>
<p>Tinnitus is common: about 20% of people between 55 and 65 years old report symptoms on a general health questionnaire, and 11.8% on more detailed tinnitus-specific questionnaires.</p>

He was the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize for his photograph depicting the 1993 famine in Sudan. He committed suicide at the age of 33. His story is depicted in the 2010 feature film, <i>The Bang-Bang-Club</i> in which he was played by Taylor Kitsch.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Carter' >More...</a><hr><h2> Apartheid in South Africa</h2><p><b>Apartheid</b> (<small>Afrikaans pronunciation: </small>[ɐˈpɑːrtɦɛit]; from Afrikaans "the state of being apart") was a system of racial segregation in South Africa enforced through legislation by the National Party (NP) governments, the ruling party from 1948 to 1994, under which the rights of the majority black inhabitants were curtailed and Afrikaner minority rule was maintained. Apartheid was developed after World War II by the Afrikaner-dominated National Party and Broederbond organisations and was practised also in South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate (revoked in 1966 via United Nations Resolution 2145), until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990.</p>
<p>Racial segregation in South Africa began in colonial times under Dutch rule. Apartheid as an official policy was introduced following the general election of 1948. Legislation classified inhabitants into four racial groups, "black", "white", "coloured", and "Indian", with Indian and coloured divided into several sub-classifications, and residential areas were segregated, sometimes by forced removals. Non-white political representation was abolished in 1970, and starting in that year black people were deprived of their citizenship, legally becoming citizens of one of ten tribally based self-governing homelands called <i>bantustans</i>, four of which became nominally independent states. The government segregated education, medical care, beaches, and other public services, and provided black people with services inferior to those of white people.</p>
<p>Apartheid sparked significant internal resistance and violence, and a long arms and trade embargo against South Africa. Since the 1950s, a series of popular uprisings and protests was met with the banning of opposition and imprisoning of anti-apartheid leaders. As unrest spread and became more effective and militarised, state organisations responded with repression and violence. Along with the sanctions placed on South Africa by the West, this made it increasingly difficult for the government to maintain the regime.</p>
<p>Reforms to apartheid in the 1980s failed to quell the mounting opposition, and in 1990 President Frederik Willem de Klerk began negotiations to end apartheid, culminating in multi-racial democratic elections in 1994, won by the African National Congress under Nelson Mandela. The vestiges of apartheid still shape South African politics and society. Although the official abolishing of apartheid occurred in 1990 with repeal of the last of the remaining apartheid laws, the end of apartheid is widely regarded as arising from the 1994 democratic general elections.</p>

</dl><p><b>Winnie Madikizela–Mandela</b> (born <b>Nomzamo Winfreda Zanyiwe Madikizela</b>; 26 September 1936) is a South African politician who has held several government positions and headed the African National Congress Women's League. She is a member of the ANC's National Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Although she was still married to Nelson Mandela at the time of his becoming president of South Africa in May 1994, the couple had separated two years earlier. Their divorce was finalised on 19 March 1996, with an unspecified out-of-court settlement. Her attempt to obtain a settlement up to US$5 million, half of what she claimed her ex-husband was worth, was dismissed when she failed to appear in court for a settlement hearing.</p>
<p>A controversial activist, she is popular among her supporters, who refer to her as the 'Mother of the Nation', yet reviled by others after the South African Truth and Reconciliation commission found "Ms Winnie Madikizela Mandela politically and morally accountable for the gross violations of human rights", concluding that she had personally been responsible for the murder, torture, abduction and assault of numerous men, women and children, as well as indirectly responsible for even larger number of such crimes. In March 2009, the Independent Electoral Commission ruled that Madikizela-Mandela, selected as an ANC candidate, could run in the April 2009 general election, despite her suspended jail sentence for fraud.</p>

It is based on the memoir of Maria von Trapp, <i>The Story of the Trapp Family Singers</i>. Many songs from the musical have become standards, such as "Edelweiss", "My Favorite Things", "Climb Ev'ry Mountain", "Do-Re-Mi", and the title song "The Sound of Music".</p>
<p>The original Broadway production, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, opened on November 16, 1959; the show has enjoyed numerous productions and revivals since then. It was adapted as a 1965 film musical starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, which won five Academy Awards. <i>The Sound of Music</i> was the final musical written by Rodgers and Hammerstein; Hammerstein died of cancer nine months after the Broadway premiere.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music' >More...</a><hr><h2> Wladimir Klitschko</h2><p><b>Wladimir Klitschko</b> (Ukrainian: Володи́мир Володи́мирович Кличко́ [<i>Volodymyr Volodymyrovych Klychko</i>]; born 25 March 1976) is a Ukrainian heavyweight professional boxer. Klitschko is the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, IBO and <i><i>The Ring</i></i> Heavyweight Champion, and is the younger brother of WBC Heavyweight Champion Vitali Klitschko. Klitschko is the longest reigning IBF, WBO &amp; IBO Heavyweight Champion in history with the most title defenses for those organizations. Overall, he is the 2nd longest reigning Heavyweight Champion of all time with the 3rd most successful title defenses at 15. On the 13th October 2013, <i>Boxrec</i> rated Klitschko as the number 2 pound-for-pound fighter in the world. <i>Ring Magazine</i> currently rates Klitschko as the number four pound-for-pound boxer in the world. Klitschko (22–2) is no. 3 on the all time list for most heavyweight title fights, only behind Joe Louis (26–1) &amp; Muhammad Ali (24–3).</p>
<p>Since 2005, Klitschko has been the dominant force in the heavyweight division, defeating a majority of the top heavyweights in the rankings. When Klitschko won the IBF title against Chris Byrd there were four separate Heavyweight Champions. Since then, he has unified the IBF, IBO, WBO &amp; WBA belts and defeated the WBA Champion in recess. Following his win over Ruslan Chagaev, Klitschko was awarded the vacant Ring Magazine Heavyweight title.</p>
<p>Klitschko has held at least a piece of the heavyweight championship since 2006, when he won the IBF title. The most recent bout in which he claimed a piece of the undisputed title was when he won the WBA championship from David Haye in 2011.</p>
