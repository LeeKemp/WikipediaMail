She was the Prime Minister of Ukraine from 24 January to 8 September 2005, and again from 18 December 2007 to 11 March 2010. Tymoshenko is the leader of the All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland", which was the largest opposition political party in Ukraine. Tymoshenko strives for Ukraine’s integration into the European Union and strongly opposes the membership of Ukraine in the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia.</p>

Known as <b>"El Chapo Guzmán"</b> ("Shorty Guzmán", <small>pronounced: </small>[el ˈtʃapo ɡusˈman]) for his 1.68 m (5 ft 6 in) stature, he became Mexico's top drug kingpin in 2003 after the arrest of his rival Osiel Cárdenas of the Gulf Cartel, and until his February 2014 arrest, he was considered the "most powerful drug trafficker in the world" by the United States Department of the Treasury.</p>
<p>Guzmán Loera has been ranked by <i>Forbes</i> magazine as one of the most powerful people in the world every year since 2009; ranking 41<sup>st</sup>, 60<sup>th</sup> and 55<sup>th</sup> respectively. He was named as the 10<sup>th</sup> richest man in Mexico (1,140<sup>th</sup> in the world) in 2011, with a net worth of roughly US$1 billion. The magazine also calls him the "biggest druglord of all time", and the DEA strongly believes he has surpassed the influence and reach of Pablo Escobar, and now considers him "the godfather of the drug world." In 2013, the Chicago Crime Commission named Guzmán "Public Enemy Number One" due to the influence of his criminal network in Chicago, though there is no evidence that Guzmán has ever been in that city The last person to receive such notoriety was Al Capone in 1930.</p>
<p>Guzmán's Sinaloa Cartel smuggles multi-ton cocaine shipments from Colombia through Mexico to the United States, and has distribution cells throughout the U.S. The organization has also been involved in the production, smuggling and distribution of Mexican methamphetamine, marijuana, and heroin. At the time of his 2014 arrest, Guzmán imported more drugs into the United States than anyone else.</p>
<p>Guzmán was captured in 1993 in Guatemala, extradited and sentenced to 20 years in prison in Mexico for murder and drug trafficking. After bribing prison guards, he was able to escape from a federal maximum-security prison in 2001. He was wanted by the governments of Mexico and the United States and by INTERPOL. The U.S. offered a US$5 million reward for information leading to his capture, and the Mexican government offered a reward of 30 million pesos (approximately US$2 million) for information on Guzmán.</p>
<p>Guzmán was arrested again by Mexican authorities in Mexico on February 22, 2014. He was found in Mazatlán, and was captured with no shots fired.</p>

<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_170' >More...</a><hr><h2> Sterile insect technique</h2><p>The <b>sterile insect technique</b> is a method of biological control, whereby overwhelming numbers of sterile insects are released. The released insects are normally male as it is the female that causes the damage, usually by laying eggs in the crop, or, in the case of mosquitoes, taking blood from humans. The sterile males compete with the wild males for female insects. If a female mates with a sterile male then it will have no offspring, thus reducing the next generation's population. Repeated release of insects can diminish small populations, though it could be impossible to eradicate it and is not efficient against dense insect populations.</p>
<p>The technique has successfully been used to eradicate the Screw-worm fly (<i>Cochliomyia hominivorax</i>) in areas of North America. There have also been many successes in controlling species of fruit flies, most particularly the Medfly (<i>Ceratitis capitata</i>), and the Mexican fruit fly (<i>Anastrepha ludens</i>).</p>
<p>Insects are mostly sterilized with radiation, which might weaken the newly sterilized insects if doses are not correctly applied, making them less able to compete with wild males. However, other sterilization techniques are under development which would not affect the insects' ability to compete for a mate.</p>
<p>The technique was pioneered in the 1950s by American entomologists Dr. Raymond C. Bushland and Dr. Edward F. Knipling. For their achievement, they jointly received the 1992 World Food Prize.</p>

He took office in February 2010 after beating Yulia Tymoshenko in a second round of voting. Four years later, on 22 February 2014, he was impeached by a vote of 328 out of 340 in the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament.</p>
<p>His first attempt to become president in 2004 failed when the Ukrainian Supreme Court nullified and ordered a re-run of the initial second-round ballot electing Yanukovych, which was fraught with allegations of fraud and voter intimidation amid widespread citizen protests and occupation of Kiev's Independence Square in what became known as the Orange Revolution. (See also Ukrainian presidential election, 2004.) Yanukovych lost the court-ordered second 2004 presidential run-off election to Viktor Yushchenko. However, Yanukovych continued to lead his party, the Party of Regions.</p>
<p>Yanukovych served as the Governor of Donetsk Oblast from 1997 to 2002. Subsequently he was Prime Minister of Ukraine from 21 November 2002 to 31 December 2004 under President Leonid Kuchma. After the failed 2004 presidential election, Yanukovych served as Prime Minister for a second time from 4 August 2006 to 18 December 2007 under President Yushchenko. On 3 March 2010, Yanukovych transferred the leadership of the party to Mykola Azarov.</p>
<p>November 2013 saw the beginning of a series of events that led to President Yanukovych's fight for survival. What started as peaceful popular protests and the occupation of Kiev's Independence Square by young pro-European Union Ukrainians over Yanukovych's rejecting the pending EU association agreement in favor of a Russian loan bailout and closer ties with Russia and dubbed Euromaidan, in January 2014 morphed into deadly clashes across Ukraine pitting ordinary Ukrainians against each other and against Yanukovych's special police units.</p>
<p>Talks with Yanukovych had failed. Ukraine was on the brink of civil war, as violent clashes led to the death of 28 protesters, 7 policemen and a civilian bystander along with 335 injured people on 18th February. Seventy more were killed and about 2,000 injured on 20 February in further bloody clashes in the capital Kiev. On 22 February 2014 MPs found the president unable to fulfill his duties and exercised constitutional powers to set an election for May 25 to select his replacement.</p>

Her story served as the inspiration for a 1956 German film that in turn inspired the Broadway musical <i>The Sound of Music</i> and subsequently the 1965 blockbuster film <i>The Sound of Music</i>.</p>
