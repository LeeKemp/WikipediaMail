		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 07 February 2014 </h1><h2> Patrick Roy</h2><p><b>Patrick Jacques Roy</b> (<small>French pronunciation: ​</small>[ʁwa]; born October 5, 1965) is a Canadian former ice hockey goaltender and the current head coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations for the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL).</p>
<p>Nicknamed "Saint Patrick," Roy split his professional career between the Montreal Canadiens, whom he played with for 10 years, and the Colorado Avalanche, whom he played with for 8 years, both of the NHL. Roy won four Stanley Cups during his career, two with each franchise. Roy was born in Quebec City, Quebec, but grew up in Cap-Rouge, Quebec.</p>
<p>In 2004, Roy was selected as the greatest goaltender in NHL history by a panel of 41 writers, coupled with a simultaneous fan poll. On November 13, 2006, Roy was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is the only player in NHL history to win the Conn Smythe Trophy (the award given to the most valuable player in the Stanley Cup playoffs) three times, in different decades, and for two different teams. Roy's No. 33 jersey is retired by both the Canadiens and Avalanche.</p>
<p>Roy is widely credited with popularising the butterfly style of goaltending, which has since become associated with goalies from Roy's native Quebec. He was the general manager, and head coach — and remains a co-owner — of the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.</p>

Many years later, he became known as Uncle Fester on 1960s sitcom <i>The Addams Family</i>. In the interim, he sued his mother and stepfather over his squandered film earnings and provoked California to enact the first known legal protection for the earnings of child performers, widely known as the Coogan Act.</p>

<p>Adopted by International Olympic Committee (IOC), it is the codification of the fundamental principles, rules and by-laws. French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Charter. If, at any time, there is a discrepancy between versions of the text, the French text prevails.</p>

On June 15, 2013, he crashed a pickup truck into pedestrians. He was 16 at the time. In December 2013, he was sentenced to therapy at a long-term, in-patient facility, after his attorneys successfully argued that the teen suffered from so-called affluenza and needed rehabilitation, and not prison. His sentence set off what the <i>New York Times</i> called "an emotional, angry debate that has stretched far beyond the North Texas suburbs".</p>

As they are found at depths of 2,000 m or 6,600 ft, they create complex localized ecosystems that supply sustenance to deep-sea organisms for decades. This is unlike in shallower waters, where a whale carcass will be consumed by scavengers over a relatively short period of time. It was with the development of deep-sea robotic exploration that whale falls were first observed in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>Organisms that have been observed at deep-sea whale falls include giant isopods, squat lobsters, bristleworms, prawns, shrimp, lobsters, hagfish, <i>Osedax</i>, crabs, sea cucumbers, and sleeper sharks.</p>
