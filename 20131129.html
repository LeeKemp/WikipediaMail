		<h1>Popular Pages - Friday 29 November 2013 </h1><h2> Lewis Collins</h2><p><b>Lewis Collins</b> (26 May 1946 – 27 November 2013) was an English actor. He was best known for his tough-guy role as Bodie in the ITV drama series <i>The Professionals</i>, which ran from 1977 to 1983.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Collins' >More...</a><hr><h2> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)</h2><p><i><b>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</b></i> is a 1990 American live-action film adaptation of the <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> franchise directed by Steve Barron. The film was followed by three sequels: <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze</i> in 1991, <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III</i> in 1993, and <i>TMNT</i> in 2007. This film presents the origin story of Splinter and the Turtles, the initial meeting between them, April O'Neil and Casey Jones, and their first confrontation with The Shredder and his Foot Clan. The film is distributed by New Line Cinema and outside the United States is internationally distributed by Golden Harvest.</p>
<p>When the New York City Police Department is unable to stop a severe crime wave caused by the Foot Clan, four vigilantes — Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael — come forth to save the city. Under the leadership of Splinter and together with their new-found allies April O'Neil and Casey Jones, they fight back and take the battle to The Shredder. The film kept very close to the dark feel of the original comics, and is a direct adaptation of the comicbook storyline involving the defeat of Shredder, with several elements also taken from the 1987 TV series that was airing at the time, such as April being a news reporter, and the turtles having different-colored masks, as opposed to the uniform red masks of the comic. The film was the second highest-grossing independent film of all time when it was released, and became the ninth highest grossing film worldwide of 1990 and the most successful film in the franchise.</p>
