		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 12 January 2014 </h1><h2> Ariel Sharon</h2><p><b>Ariel Sharon</b> (Hebrew:  אריאל שרון‎, Arabic: أرئيل شارون‎, <i>Ariʼēl Sharōn</i>, also known by his diminutive Arik, אַריק, born <b>Ariel Scheinermann</b>, אריאל שיינרמן‎; 26 February 1928 – 11 January 2014) was an Israeli statesman and general, who served as the 11th Prime Minister of Israel until he was incapacitated by a stroke.</p>
<p>Sharon was a commander in the Israeli Army from its creation in 1948. As a paratrooper and then an officer, he participated prominently in the 1948 War of Independence, becoming a platoon commander in the Alexandroni Brigade and taking part in many battles, including Operation Ben Nun Alef. He was an instrumental figure in the creation of Unit 101, and the Retribution operations, as well as in the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Six-Day War of 1967, the War of Attrition, and the Yom-Kippur War of 1973. As Minister of Defense, he directed the 1982 Lebanon War.</p>
<p>During his military career, he was considered the greatest field commander in Israel's history, and one of the country's greatest ever military strategists. After his assault of the Sinai in the Six-Day War and his encirclement of the Egyptian Third Army in the Yom Kippur War, the Israeli public nicknamed him "The King of Israel," and "The Lion of God", a pun on his given name.</p>
<p>After retiring from the army, Sharon joined the Likud party, and served in a number of ministerial posts in Likud-led governments in 1977–92 and 1996–99. He became the leader of the Likud in 2000, and served as Israel's Prime Minister from 2001 to 2006. In 1983 the Kahan Commission, established by the Israeli Government, found that as Minister of Defense during the 1982 Lebanon War Sharon bore "personal responsibility" for the massacre by Lebanese militias of Palestinian civilians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila, for his having disregarded the prospect of acts of bloodshed by the Phalangists against the population of the refugee camps, and not having prevented their entry. The Kahan Commission recommended Sharon's removal as Defense Minister, and Sharon did resign after initially refusing to do so.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Sharon championed construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, as Prime Minister, in 2004–05 Sharon orchestrated Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip. Facing stiff opposition to this policy within the Likud, in November 2005 he left Likud to form a new party, Kadima. He had been expected to win the next election and was widely interpreted as planning on "clearing Israel out of most of the West Bank", in a series of unilateral withdrawals. However, Sharon suffered a stroke on 4 January 2006 and was left in a persistent vegetative state until his death eight years later, on 11 January 2014.</p>

The song is a nostalgic remembrance of her glorious past and a declaration of her wishes to start a new life. Sung briefly in the first act and in full near the end of the show, "Memory" is the climax of the musical, and by far its most popular and well-known song.</p>

The film is based on the 2007 nonfiction book of the same name by Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson. Set during the War in Afghanistan, the film dramatizes the failed United States Navy SEALs mission Operation Red Wings, in which a four-man SEAL team was tasked to capture or kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shah.</p>
<p>Development of the film began in 2007 after Berg first learned of the book while filming <i>Hancock</i>. He arranged several meetings with Luttrell to discuss adapting the book to film. Universal Pictures won the film rights in August 2007, after bidding against other major film studios. In re-enacting the events of Operation Red Wings, Berg drew much of his screenplay from Luttrell's eyewitness accounts in the book, as well as autopsy and incident reports related to the mission. After directing <i>Battleship</i> for Universal in 2012, Berg returned to work on <i>Lone Survivor</i>. Principal photography began in October 2012, and concluded in November after 42 days; filming took place on location in New Mexico, using digital cinematography. Luttrell and several other Navy SEAL veterans acted as technical advisors, while multiple branches of the United States Armed Forces aided the film's production. In addition, the main actors had three weeks of military training beforehand to prepare for the physical demands of their roles.</p>
<p><i>Lone Survivor</i> opened in limited release in the United States on December 25, 2013, before opening across North America on January 10, 2014. The film received mostly positive reviews; critics praised Berg's direction, as well as the acting, story, visuals and battle sequences. Other reviewers however derided the film for focusing more on its action scenes than on characterization.</p>
