		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 05 November 2013 </h1><h2> Raymond Loewy</h2><p><b>Raymond Loewy</b> (November 5, 1893 – July 14, 1986) was a French-born American industrial designer who achieved fame for the magnitude of his design efforts across a variety of industries. He was recognized for this by <i>Time</i> magazine and featured on its cover on October 31, 1949.</p>
<p>He spent most of his professional career in the United States. Among his designs were the Shell, Exxon, TWA and the former BP logos, the Greyhound Scenicruiser bus, Coca-Cola vending machines, the Pennsylvania Railroad GG1 and S-1 locomotives, the Lucky Strike package, Coldspot refrigerators, the Studebaker Avanti and Champion, and the Air Force One livery. His career spanned seven decades.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Loewy' >More...</a><hr><h2> Desmond Tutu</h2><p><b>Desmond Mpilo Tutu</b> (born 7 October 1931) is a South African social rights activist and retired Anglican bishop who rose to worldwide fame during the 1980s as an opponent of apartheid. He was the first black South African Archbishop of Cape Town and primate of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa (now the Anglican Church of Southern Africa).</p>
<p>Tutu's admirers see him as a man who since the demise of apartheid has been active in the defence of human rights and uses his high profile to campaign for the oppressed, though his consistent opposition to Israel and the United States has made him controversial. He has campaigned to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, poverty, racism, sexism, the imprisonment of Chelsea Manning, homophobia and transphobia. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984; the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism in 1986; the Pacem in Terris Award in 1987; the Sydney Peace Prize in 1999; the Gandhi Peace Prize in 2007; and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009. He has also compiled several books of his speeches and sayings.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Tutu' >More...</a><hr><h2> Guy Fawkes Night</h2><p><b>Guy Fawkes Night</b>, also known as <b>Guy Fawkes Day</b>, <b>Bonfire Night</b> and <b>Firework Night</b>, is an annual commemoration observed on 5 November, primarily in Great Britain. Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605, when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested while guarding explosives the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords. Celebrating the fact that King James I had survived the attempt on his life, people lit bonfires around London, and months later the introduction of the Observance of 5th November Act enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure.</p>
<p>Within a few decades Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was known, became the predominant English state commemoration, but as it carried strong religious overtones it also became a focus for anti-Catholic sentiment. Puritans delivered sermons regarding the perceived dangers of popery, while during increasingly raucous celebrations common folk burnt effigies of popular hate-figures, such as the pope. Towards the end of the 18th century reports appear of children begging for money with effigies of Guy Fawkes and 5 November gradually became known as Guy Fawkes Day. Towns such as Lewes and Guildford were in the 19th century scenes of increasingly violent class-based confrontations, fostering traditions those towns celebrate still, albeit peaceably. In the 1850s changing attitudes eventually resulted in the toning down of much of the day's anti-Catholic rhetoric, and the Observance of 5th November Act was repealed in 1859. Eventually, the violence was dealt with, and by the 20th century Guy Fawkes Day had become an enjoyable social commemoration, although lacking much of its original focus. The present-day Guy Fawkes Night is usually celebrated at large organised events, centred on a bonfire and extravagant firework displays.</p>
<p>Settlers exported Guy Fawkes Night to overseas colonies, including some in North America, where it was known as Pope Day. Those festivities died out with the onset of the American Revolution. Claims that Guy Fawkes Night was a Protestant replacement for older customs like Samhain are disputed, although another old celebration, Halloween, has lately increased in popularity, and according to some writers, may threaten the continued observance of 5 November.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night' >More...</a><hr><h2> Guy Fawkes</h2><p><b>Guy Fawkes</b> (13 April 1570 – 31 January 1606), also known as <b>Guido Fawkes</b>, the name he adopted while fighting for the Spanish in the Low Countries, was a member of a group of provincial English Catholics who planned the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605.</p>
<p>Fawkes was born and educated in York. His father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a recusant Catholic. Fawkes later converted to Catholicism and left for the continent, where he fought in the Eighty Years' War on the side of Catholic Spain against Protestant Dutch reformers. He travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England but was unsuccessful. He later met Thomas Wintour, with whom he returned to England.</p>
<p>Wintour introduced Fawkes to Robert Catesby, who planned to assassinate King James I and restore a Catholic monarch to the throne. The plotters secured the lease to an undercroft beneath the House of Lords, and Fawkes was placed in charge of the gunpowder they stockpiled there. Prompted by the receipt of an anonymous letter, the authorities searched Westminster Palace during the early hours of 5 November, and found Fawkes guarding the explosives. Over the next few days, he was questioned and tortured, and eventually he broke. Immediately before his execution on 31 January, Fawkes jumped from the scaffold where he was to be hanged and broke his neck, thus avoiding the agony of the mutilation that followed.</p>
<p>Fawkes became synonymous with the Gunpowder Plot, the failure of which has been commemorated in England since 5 November 1605. His effigy is traditionally burned on a bonfire, commonly accompanied by a firework display.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes' >More...</a><hr><h2> Gunner (dog)</h2><p><b>Gunner</b> (born c. August 1941) was a stray male kelpie who became notable for his reliability to accurately alert allied airforce personnel that Japanese aircraft were approaching Darwin during World War II.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunner_%28dog%29' >More...</a><hr><h2> Cher</h2><p><b>Cher</b> (/ˈʃɛər/; born <b>Cherilyn Sarkisian</b>; May 20, 1946) is an American singer and actress. Recognized for having brought the sense of female autonomy and self-actualization into the entertainment industry, she is known for her distinctive contralto singing voice and for having worked in various areas of entertainment, as well as continuously reinventing both her music and image, which has led to her being nicknamed the Goddess of Pop.</p>
<p>Cher became prominent in 1965 as one-half of the folk rock husband–wife duo Sonny &amp; Cher, who popularized a particular smooth sound that successfully competed with the dominant British Invasion and Motown sounds of the era. From 1965, she had established herself as a solo artist with successful singles such as "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)", "Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves", "Half-Breed", and "Dark Lady", songs that deal with subjects rarely addressed in American popular music. <i>Goldmine</i> magazine's Phill Marder described her as the leader of an effort in the 1960s to "advance feminine rebellion in the rock world [and] the prototype of the female rock star, setting the standard for appearance [and] attitude". After the duo's drug-free lifestyle had lost its popular appeal in the United States owing to the drug culture of the 1960s, she returned to stardom in the 1970s as a television personality with her shows <i>The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour</i> and <i>Cher</i>, both of which attained immense popularity. She became a fashion trendsetter with her daring outfits. After Cher and Sonny divorced in 1975, Cher experimented with various musical styles, including disco and new wave, before becoming a successful live act in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Cher made her Broadway debut and starred in the film <i>Silkwood</i>, which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1983. In the following years, she starred in films such as <i>Mask</i>, <i>The Witches of Eastwick</i>, and <i>Moonstruck</i>, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1988. She made her directorial debut in the 1996 film <i>If These Walls Could Talk</i>. At the same time, she established herself as a rock singer by releasing platinum albums such as <i>Heart of Stone</i> (1989) and successful singles such as "I Found Someone" and "If I Could Turn Back Time". Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Cher continued to experiment with musical styles, including R&amp;B and dance. She reached a new commercial peak in 1998 with the song "Believe", which features the pioneering use of Auto-Tune, also known as the "Cher effect". She has not toured since the 2002–2005 Living Proof: The Farewell Tour. In 2008, she signed a $60 million per-year deal to headline the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for three years. The 2010s kicked off with Cher's return to film in <i>Burlesque</i>. In 2013, she released her first studio album in over eleven years, <i>Closer to the Truth</i>. It became her highest-charting solo album in the US to date.</p>
<p>Cher has won an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival, among several other honors. Her other ventures have included fashion designing, writing books and managing the film production company Isis. Recognized as one of the best-selling music artists of all time, she has sold more than 100 million solo albums and over 40 million records as Sonny &amp; Cher worldwide. She is the only artist to date to have a number-one single on a <i>Billboard</i> chart in each of the past six decades.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher' >More...</a><hr><h2> Jonathan Martin (American football)</h2><p><b>Jonathan Martin</b> (born August 19, 1989) is an American football offensive tackle for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Stanford University. He was selected by the Dolphins in the second round of the 2012 NFL Draft.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Martin_(American_football)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Human cannonball</h2><p>The <b>human cannonball</b> act is a performance in which a person (the "cannonball") is ejected from a specially designed "cannon". The human cannonball lands on a horizontal net or inflated bag, the placement of which is determined by classical mechanics. Outdoor performances may also aim at a body of water.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cannonball' >More...</a><hr><h2> Human computer</h2><p>The term "<b>computer</b>", in use from the early 17th century (the first known written reference dates from 1613), meant "one who computes": a person performing mathematical calculations, before electronic computers became commercially available. "The human computer is supposed to be following fixed rules; he has no authority to deviate from them in any detail." (Turing, 1950) Teams of people were frequently used to undertake long and often tedious calculations; the work was divided so that this could be done in parallel.</p>
<p>Since the end of the 20th century, the term "human computer" has also been applied to individuals with prodigious powers of mental arithmetic, also known as mental calculators. The first time the term "Computer" appeared in the <i>New York Times</i> was in May 2, 1892; the ad by the US Civil Service Commission stated:</p>
<dl><dd>"A Computer Wanted. [...] The examination will include the subjects of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and astronomy."</dd>
</dl><p>The term <b>Human computer</b> is also associated with Shakuntala Devi who demonstrated outstanding computing abilities since her childhood. She competed and won several competitions of mathematical calculation speed against computers.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer' >More...</a><hr><h2> PRR S1</h2><p>The <b>PRR S1</b> class steam locomotive (nicknamed "The Big Engine") was a single experimental locomotive, the longest and heaviest rigid frame reciprocating steam locomotive ever built. The streamlined Art Deco styled shell of the locomotive was designed by Raymond Loewy.</p>
<p>The S1 was the only locomotive ever built with a 6-4-4-6 wheel arrangement. It was a duplex locomotive, meaning that it had two pairs of cylinders, each driving two pairs of driving wheels. Unlike similar-looking articulated locomotive designs, the driven wheelbase of the S1 was rigid. The S1 was completed January 31, 1939 and was numbered 6100.</p>
<p>At 140 ft 2<sup> 1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> in (42.74 m) overall, engine and tender, the S1 was the longest reciprocating steam locomotive ever; it was too big for many PRR curves. Along with wheel slippage, this limited the S1's usefulness. No further S1 models were built as focus shifted to the T1 class. The last run for the S1 was in December 1945 and the engine was scrapped in 1949.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRR_S1' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-11-05 11:30:08 -0500 -->
