		<h1>Popular Pages - Saturday 26 October 2013 </h1><h2> June and Jennifer Gibbons</h2><p><b>June and Jennifer Gibbons</b> (born 11 April 1963; Jennifer died in 1993) were identical twins who grew up in Wales. They became known as 'The Silent Twins' owing to their choice to communicate only with their immediate family. They began writing works of fiction but turned to crime in a bid for recognition. Both women were committed to Broadmoor Hospital where they were held for 14 years.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_and_Jennifer_Gibbons' >More...</a><hr><h2> Glowsticking</h2><p><b>Glowsticking</b> is a form of dancing with glowsticks or other glowstick-like instruments that share the same qualities: durability, consistency in light, safe to toss around, and the material of which they are made, often a soft and pliant plastic.</p>
<p>Glowsticking is an "umbrella term" describing two broad categories of glowsticking, with the most agreed upon separation being whether it is stringed or not stringed. More importantly, glowsticking has roots in the electronica and rave scenes, and has a cultural paradigm more in common with those scenes than those of other scenes. Some aspects include the culture of non-competitiveness, preferring sharing and performing in accordance with your observer, without any kind of negative statement implied. Because of this glowsticking competitions are frowned upon by most practitioners of glowsticking. Although glowsticking as a field can largely be practiced anywhere, the roots it has with raving has led to the adoption of most of the ideals of the rave scene. In recent days complete glow stick costumes have been created that attach to ones body, the two most popular being from Crayola and Glowstickables.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glowsticking' >More...</a><hr><h2> Hybrid Assistive Limb</h2><ol><li>REDIRECT HAL (robot)  </li>

The six-year-old's body was found in the basement of the family home about eight hours after she was reported missing during a police search of her home. She had been struck on the head and strangled. The case remains unsolved, even after several grand jury hearings, and continues to generate public and media interest.</p>
<p>Colorado law enforcement agencies initially suspected JonBenét's parents and her brother. However, the family was partially exonerated in 2003 when DNA taken from the victim's clothes suggested they were not involved. Her parents would not be completely cleared until July 2008. In February 2009, the Boulder Police Department took the case back from the district attorney to reopen the investigation.</p>
<p>Media coverage of the case has often focused on JonBenét's participation in child beauty pageants, her parents' affluence and the unusual evidence in the case. Reports have also questioned the police's overall handling of the case. Several defamation suits have been filed against several media organizations by Ramsey family members and their friends over reporting of the murder.</p>
<p>On October 25, 2013, previously sealed court documents were released, showing that a Colorado grand jury had voted in 1999 to indict John and Patricia Ramsey in the murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey on charges of child abuse resulting in death and being accessories to a crime. However, then-District Attorney Alex Hunter, a personal friend of the Ramseys,<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> refused to sign the indictment.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_JonBen%C3%A9t_Ramsey' >More...</a><hr><h2> October 25</h2><p><b>October 25</b> is the 298th day of the year (299th in leap years) in the Gregorian calendar. There are 67 days remaining until the end of the year.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_25' >More...</a><hr><h2> Cher</h2><p><b>Cher</b> (/ˈʃɛər/; born <b>Cherilyn Sarkisian</b>; May 20, 1946) is an American singer and actress. Recognized for having brought the sense of female autonomy and self-actualization into the entertainment industry, she is known for her distinctive contralto singing voice and for having worked in various areas of entertainment, as well as continuously reinventing both her music and image, which has led to her being nicknamed the Goddess of Pop.</p>
<p>Cher became prominent in 1965 as one-half of the folk rock husband–wife duo Sonny &amp; Cher, who popularized a particular smooth sound that successfully competed with the dominant British Invasion and Motown sounds of the era. From 1965, she had established herself as a solo artist with successful singles such as "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)", "Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves", "Half-Breed", and "Dark Lady", songs that deal with subjects rarely addressed in American popular music. <i>Goldmine</i> magazine's Phill Marder described her as the leader of an effort in the 1960s to "advance feminine rebellion in the rock world [and] the prototype of the female rock star, setting the standard for appearance [and] attitude". After the duo's drug-free lifestyle had lost its popular appeal in the United States owing to the drug culture of the 1960s, she returned to stardom in the 1970s as a television personality with her shows <i>The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour</i> and <i>Cher</i>, both of which attained immense popularity. She became a fashion trendsetter with her daring outfits. After Cher and Sonny divorced in 1975, Cher experimented with various musical styles, including disco and new wave, before becoming a successful live act in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Cher made her Broadway debut and starred in the film <i>Silkwood</i>, which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1983. In the following years, she starred in films such as <i>Mask</i>, <i>The Witches of Eastwick</i>, and <i>Moonstruck</i>, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1988. She made her directorial debut in the 1996 film <i>If These Walls Could Talk</i>. At the same time, she established herself as a rock singer by releasing platinum albums such as <i>Heart of Stone</i> (1989) and successful singles such as "I Found Someone" and "If I Could Turn Back Time". Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Cher continued to experiment with musical styles, including R&amp;B and dance. She reached a new commercial peak in 1998 with the song "Believe", which features the pioneering use of Auto-Tune, also known as the "Cher effect". She has not toured since the 2002–2005 Living Proof: The Farewell Tour. In 2008, she signed a $60 million per-year deal to headline the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for three years. The 2010s kicked off with Cher's return to the big screen in <i>Burlesque</i>. In 2013, she released her first studio album in over eleven years, <i>Closer to the Truth</i>. It became her highest-charting solo album in the US to date.</p>
<p>Cher has won an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival, among several other honors. Her other ventures have included fashion designing, writing books and managing the film production company Isis. Recognized as one of the best-selling music artists of all time, she has sold more than 100 million solo albums and over 40 million records as Sonny &amp; Cher worldwide. She is the only artist to date to have a number-one single on a <i>Billboard</i> chart in each of the past six decades.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher' >More...</a><hr><h2> Gravity (film)</h2><p><i><b>Gravity</b></i> is a 2013 3D science fiction thriller and space drama film directed, co-written, co-produced and co-edited by Alfonso Cuarón.
