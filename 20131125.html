The two were killed on the night of 15–16 May 2008 at Aarushi's home. The case aroused public interest as a whodunit story. It received heavy media coverage in India, and was also covered by the foreign media. The sensational nature of the media coverage, which included salacious allegations against Aarushi and the suspects, was criticized by many as a trial by media.</p>
<p>When Aarushi's body was discovered on 16 May, the missing live-in servant Hemraj was considered as the main suspect. However, the next day, his dead body was discovered on the terrace. The police was heavily criticized for botching up the investigation by failing to secure the crime scene and not following important leads immediately.</p>
<p>Initially, the Talwars' former servant Vishnu Sharma was considered as a suspect, as he had lost his job to Hemraj. However, soon, Aarushi's parents (Dr. Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar) became the main suspects. The police believed that Aarushi's father Rajesh had murdered the two after learning about a sexual relationship between them, or that Rajesh had hit Aarushi fatally after she confronted him about his alleged extra-marital affair (while Hemraj was killed as he was a witness to Aarushi's death). An alternative theory stated that Hemraj was the main target of the killing as he was blackmailing Rajesh, while Aarushi was killed for being a witness. The accusations enraged the friends and family members of the Talwars, who alleged that the police was trying to frame the parents in a bid to cover up its own incompetence and botched-up investigation. On 31 May, the case was transferred from the Uttar Pradesh Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Rajesh was released in June 2008, after the investigators could not find any solid evidence against him.</p>
<p>By this time, the CBI's suspicion had moved to Hemraj's Nepali acquaintances: Krishna (an assistant at the Talwars' clinic), Rajkumar and Vijay (domestic servants). According to the CBI, the three men were let in the house by Hemraj. Krishna, who worked as an assistant at the Talwars' clinic, held a grudge against Rajesh, who had reprimanded him for an occupational mistake. The investigators suspected that the three men tried to sexually assault Aarushi and killed her when she resisted; Hemraj was killed as he was the only witness to their entry in the house. The CBI claimed that the three men had confessed to the crime in narco tests after being injected with sodium pentothal. However, there were accusations that the three men had been drilled with misinformation prior to their tests, and their lawyer later approached the NHRC with video recordings of the tests that allegedly showed the CBI "putting words in their mouths" and torturing them to confess the crimes. Their supporters claimed that the investigators were trying to frame the poor Nepalis in order to protect the upper-class Talwars. Ultimately, all the suspects were released due to the lack of any hard evidence: all of them had alibis and their DNA or fingerprints were not found at the crime scene.</p>
<p>Unable to achieve any further breakthrough, in 2009, CBI handed over the investigation to a new team. After a second investigation, this new team argued that the case should be closed, citing "critical and substantial gaps" in the circumstantial evidence collected and an "absence of a clear-cut motive and incomplete understanding of the sequence of events." It named Rajesh Talwar as the only possible suspect, but stated that there was not enough evidence to charge him. The parents opposed the closure, criticizing the report's conclusion as baseless. The court noted that there was enough evidence to charge the parents, and ordered proceedings against them. The Talwars pleaded guilty, as they had done before. A special CBI court on 25th November 2013 held dentist couple Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar guilty of the murder of their daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj Banjade. The sentencing will be done on 26th November 2013.</p>
