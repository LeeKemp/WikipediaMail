Winning all three of these Thoroughbred horse races is considered the greatest accomplishment of a Thoroughbred racehorse. The term originated in mid-19th century England and different nations where thoroughbred racing is popular each have their own Triple Crown series.</p>

This commonly occurs during deliberate knuckle-cracking. It is possible to crack many joints, such as those in the back and neck vertebrae, hips, neck, wrists, elbows, shoulders, toes, ankles, knees, jaws, feet, and the Achilles tendon area.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_joints' >More...</a><hr><h2> California Chrome</h2><p><b>California Chrome</b> (foaled February 18, 2011) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse bred in California. He has won the 2014 Kentucky Derby and the 2014 Preakness Stakes, extending a winning streak to six races that also included the Santa Anita Derby and the San Felipe Stakes. Trained by the father-son team of Art Sherman and Alan Sherman, the colt was the first horse they entered in the Kentucky Derby. As a young man, the elder Sherman was the exercise rider for the 1955 Kentucky Derby winner Swaps, another California-bred horse. California Chrome's owners are Perry and Denise Martin from Yuba City, California and Steve and Carolyn Coburn of Topaz Lake, Nevada.</p>
<p>A grandson of Pulpit, with two lines to Swaps on his dam's side of his pedigree, the chestnut-colored horse was named for his flashy white markings, called "chrome" in the world of horse aficionados. California Chrome was a large foal at birth and was the first foal of his dam, Love The Chase. Nicknamed "Junior" in honor of his sire, Lucky Pulpit, he was sent to the Shermans' training stable as a two-year-old owing to their reputation for patiently developing young horses. The colt's first win was in his second race, but he had trouble winning consistently until he was paired with jockey Victor Espinoza for the King Glorious Stakes on December 22, 2013. He won that race and has been undefeated since.</p>
<p>Arriving in Kentucky less than a week before the Derby, the colt drew the 5th post position and was the morning line favorite, though analysts at Churchill Downs were critical of the colt, his trainer's strategy, and downplayed his chances of winning. He won by 1<sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> lengths, even after being eased for the final 70 yards (64 m), in a ride by Espinoza that Art Sherman described as "perfect". Shipping to Pimlico Race Course the Monday prior to the race, a minor media frenzy erupted on Thursday when the horse was noticed coughing after a workout. Given a clean bill of health by a veterinarian, he started at 3–5 odds as the favorite and won by 1-<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> lengths.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Chrome' >More...</a><hr><h2> Preakness Stakes</h2><p>The <b>Preakness Stakes</b> is an American flat thoroughbred horse race held on the third Saturday in May each year at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. It is a Grade 1 race run over a distance of 9.5 furlongs (1 3/16 miles) on dirt. Colts and geldings carry 126 pounds (57 kg); fillies 121 lb (55 kg). It is the second leg of the US Triple Crown, following the Kentucky Derby and followed by the Belmont Stakes.</p>
<p>First run in 1873, the Preakness Stakes was named by a former Maryland Governor after a winning colt at Pimlico. The race has been termed "The Run for the Black-Eyed Susans" because a blanket of yellow flowers altered to resemble Maryland's state flower is placed around the winner's neck. Attendance at the Preakness Stakes ranks second in North America only trailing the Kentucky Derby.</p>
<p>The 139th running of <b>The Preakness Stakes</b> took place on Saturday, May 17, 2014 for a purse of $1,500,000.</p>
