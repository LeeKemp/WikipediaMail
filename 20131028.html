		<h1>Popular Pages - Monday 28 October 2013 </h1><h2> Edith Head</h2><p><b>Edith Head</b> (October 28, 1897 – October 24, 1981) was an American costume designer who won eight Academy Awards, more than any other designer.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Head' >More...</a><hr><h2> Lou Reed</h2><p><b>Lewis Allan</b> "<b>Lou</b>" <b>Reed</b> (March 2, 1942 – October 27, 2013) was an American rock musician and songwriter. After being guitarist, vocalist, and principal songwriter of the Velvet Underground, his solo career spanned several decades. The Velvet Underground were a commercial failure in the late 1960s, but the group has gained a considerable cult following in the years since its demise and has gone on to become one of the most widely cited and influential bands of the era – hence Brian Eno's famous quote that while the Velvet Underground's debut album only sold 30,000 copies, "everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band."</p>
<p>After his departure from the group, Reed began a solo career in 1972. He had a hit the following year with "Walk on the Wild Side", but subsequently lacked the mainstream commercial success its chart status seemed to indicate. In 1975, Reed released a double album of feedback loops, <i>Metal Machine Music</i>, upon which he later commented, "No one is supposed to be able to do a thing like that and survive." Reed was known for his distinctive deadpan voice, poetic lyrics and for pioneering and coining the term ostrich guitar tuning.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Reed' >More...</a><hr><h2> Deathstroke</h2><p><b>Deathstroke the Terminator</b> (also known by his name <b>Slade Wilson</b>, originally called simply the <b>Terminator</b>) is a fictional comic book supervillain, and sometimes antihero, who appears in books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Marv Wolfman and George Perez. He is a mercenary and assassin who first appeared in <i>The New Teen Titans</i> (vol. 1) #2 (1980). <i>Wizard Magazine</i> rated him the 84th greatest villain of all time and the 72nd greatest comic book character of all time. Also, in 2009, Deathstroke was ranked as IGN's 32nd greatest comic book villain of all time.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathstroke' >More...</a><hr><h2> Hell in a Cell (2013)</h2><p><b>Hell in a Cell (2013)</b> was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by WWE and sponsored by WWE 2K14. It took place on October 27, 2013 at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida. It was the fifth annual Hell in a Cell event.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_in_a_Cell_(2013)' >More...</a><hr><h2> The Velvet Underground</h2><p><b>The Velvet Underground</b> was an American rock band, active between 1964 and 1973, formed in New York City by Lou Reed and John Cale, who both went on to find success as solo artists.</p>
<p>Although experiencing little commercial success while together, the band is often cited by many critics as one of the most important and influential groups of the 1960s. In a 1982 interview Brian Eno made the often repeated statement that while the first Velvet Underground album may have sold only 30,000 copies in its early years, "everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band."</p>
<p>Andy Warhol managed the Velvet Underground and it was the house band at his studio, the Factory, and his Exploding Plastic Inevitable events. The provocative lyrics of some of the band's songs gave a nihilistic outlook to some of their music.</p>
<p>Their 1967 debut album, <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i> (which featured German singer Nico, with whom the band collaborated), was named the 13th <i>Greatest Album of All Time</i>, and the "most prophetic rock album ever made" by <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 2003. In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked the band No. 19 on its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, by Patti Smith.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground' >More...</a><hr><h2> Roller Coaster Tycoon</h2><ol><li>REDIRECT RollerCoaster Tycoon</li>

It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, often called the <i>Pythagorean equation</i>:</p>
<dl><dd></dd>
</dl><p>where <i>c</i> represents the length of the hypotenuse, and <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> represent the lengths of the other two sides.</p>
<p>The Pythagorean theorem is named after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras (<i>ca.</i> 570 BC—<i>ca.</i> 495 BC), who by tradition is credited with its proof, although it is often argued that knowledge of the theorem predates him. There is evidence that Babylonian mathematicians understood the formula, although there is little surviving evidence that they used it in a mathematical framework. Also, Mesopotamian, Indian and Chinese mathematicians have all been known for independently discovering the result, some even providing proofs of special cases.</p>
<p>The theorem has numerous proofs, possibly the most of any mathematical theorem. These are very diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years. The theorem can be generalized in various ways, including higher-dimensional spaces, to spaces that are not Euclidean, to objects that are not right triangles, and indeed, to objects that are not triangles at all, but <i>n</i>-dimensional solids. The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness, mystique, or intellectual power; popular references in literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps and cartoons abound.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem' >More...</a><hr><h2> The Walking Dead (TV series)</h2><p><i><b>The Walking Dead</b></i> is an American horror drama television series developed by Frank Darabont. It is based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. The series stars Andrew Lincoln as sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes, who awakens from a coma to find a post-apocalyptic world dominated by flesh-eating zombies. He sets out to find his family and encounters many other survivors along the way.</p>
<p><i>The Walking Dead</i> premiered on October 31, 2010, on the cable television channel AMC in the United States. It premiered internationally during the first week of November 2010 on Fox International Channels. Based on its reception, AMC renewed the series for a second season of 13 episodes, which premiered on October 16, 2011. Two episodes into the second season, AMC announced that the show would return for a third season of 16 episodes, which began airing on October 14, 2012. On December 21, 2012, AMC renewed <i>The Walking Dead</i> for a fourth season of 16 episodes, which premiered on October 13, 2013.</p>
<p>The series has been well received and has received many award nominations including ones for the Writers Guild of America Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series (Drama). The series has also attained strong Nielsen ratings, surpassing various records for a cable series, including receiving 16.1 million viewers for its season four premiere to become the most-watched drama series telecast in basic cable history.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Execution of George Spencer</h2><p><b>George Spencer</b> (c.1600 – April 8, 1642) was the first non-native person to be executed in Connecticut. Amongst his charges was sodomy after an alleged sexual act with an animal.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_George_Spencer' >More...</a><hr><h2> Laurie Anderson</h2><p><b>Laura Phillips</b> "<b>Laurie</b>" <b>Anderson</b> (born June 5, 1947) is an American experimental performance artist, composer and musician who plays violin and keyboards and sings in a variety of experimental music and art rock styles. Initially trained as a sculptor, Anderson did her first performance-art piece in the late 1960s. Throughout the 1970s, Anderson did a variety of different performance-art activities. She became widely known outside the art world in 1981 when her single "O Superman" reached number two on the UK pop charts. She also starred in and directed the 1986 concert film <i>Home of the Brave</i>.</p>
<p>Anderson is a pioneer in electronic music and has invented several devices that she has used in her recordings and performance art shows. In 1977, she created a tape-bow violin that uses recorded magnetic tape on the bow instead of horsehair and a magnetic tape head in the bridge. In the late 1990s, she developed a talking stick, a six-foot-long baton-like MIDI controller that can access and replicate sounds.</p>
<p>Anderson was married to singer-songwriter and guitarist Lou Reed from 2008 until his death on October 27, 2013.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Anderson' >More...</a><hr><h2> The Walking Dead (season 4)</h2><p>The fourth season of AMC's television series <i>The Walking Dead</i> premiered on October 13, 2013, to consist of 16 episodes. The series is based on the series of comic books of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard; it was developed for television by Frank Darabont, and is executive produced by Kirkman, Scott M. Gimple, Greg Nicotero, and Gale Anne Hurd. Gimple assumed the role of showrunner after the departure of Glen Mazzara at the conclusion of the previous season. The season introduces the notable comic characters Abraham Ford, Eugene Porter, Rosita Espinosa, and Bob Stookey.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(season_4)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Giraffe</h2><p>The <b>giraffe</b> (<i>Giraffa camelopardalis</i>) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Its species name refers to its camel-like appearance and the patches of color on its fur. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones and its distinctive coat patterns. It stands 5–6 m (16–20 ft) tall and has an average weight of 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) for males and 830 kg (1,830 lb) for females. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. The nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.</p>
<p>The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. Giraffes are preyed on by lions, and calves are also targeted by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. Adult giraffes do not have strong social bonds, though they do gather in loose aggregations if they happen to be moving in the same general direction. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.</p>
<p>The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Least Concern, but has been extirpated from many parts of its former range, and some subspecies are classified as Endangered. Nevertheless, giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe' >More...</a><hr><h2> Myrica</h2><p><i><b>Myrica</b></i> /mɪˈraɪkə/ is a genus of about 35–50 species of small trees and shrubs in the family Myricaceae, order Fagales. The genus has a wide distribution, including Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America, and missing only from Australia. Some botanists split the genus into two genera on the basis of the catkin and fruit structure, restricting <i>Myrica</i> to a few species, and treating the others in <i>Morella</i>.</p>
<p>Common names include <b>Bayberry</b>, <b>Bay-rum tree</b>, <b>Candleberry</b>, <b>Sweet Gale</b>, and <b>Wax-myrtle</b>. The generic name was derived from the Greek word μυρικη (<i>myrike</i>), meaning "fragrance."</p>

<p>The species vary from 1 m shrubs up to 20 m trees; some are deciduous, but the majority of species are evergreen. The roots have nitrogen-fixing bacteria which enable the plants to grow on soils that are very poor in nitrogen content. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple, 2–12 cm long, oblanceolate with a tapered base and broader tip, and a crinkled or finely toothed margin. The flowers are catkins, with male and female catkins usually on separate plants (dioecious). The fruit is a small drupe, usually with a wax coating.</p>
<p>The type species, <i>Myrica gale</i>, is holarctic in distribution, growing in acidic peat bogs throughout the colder parts of the Northern Hemisphere; it is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 m tall. The remaining species all have relatively small ranges, and are mostly warm-temperate.</p>
<p><i>Myrica faya</i> (<i>Morella faya</i>), native to the volcanic islands of Madeira and the Canary Islands, has become an invasive species on the Hawaiian volcanoes  where it was introduced in the 19th century; its ability to fix nitrogen makes it very well adapted to growing on low-nitrogen volcanic soils.</p>
<p>The wax coating on the fruit is indigestible for most birds, but a few species have adapted to be able to eat it, notably the Yellow-rumped Warbler in North America. As the wax is very energy-rich, this enables the Yellow-rumped Warbler to winter further north in cooler climates than any other American warbler if bayberries are present. The seeds are then dispersed in the birds' droppings. <i>Myrica</i> species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Brown-tail, Emperor Moth, and Winter Moth as well as the bucculatricid leaf-miners <i>Bucculatrix cidarella</i>, <i>Bucculatrix myricae</i> (feeds exclusively on <i>Myrica gale</i>) and <i>Bucculatrix paroptila</i> and the <i>Coleophora</i> case-bearers <i>C. comptoniella</i>, <i>C. pruniella</i>, and <i>C. viminetella</i>.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrica' >More...</a><hr><h2> The Velvet Underground & Nico</h2><p><i><b>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</b></i> is the debut album by American rock band The Velvet Underground and vocal collaborator Nico. It was originally released in March 1967 by Verve Records. Recorded in 1966 during Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable multimedia event tour, <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i> would gain notoriety for its experimentalist performance sensibilities, as well as the focus on controversial subject matter expressed in many of its songs including drug abuse, prostitution, sadism and masochism and sexual deviancy.</p>
<p>Though a commercial and critical failure upon release, the record has since become one of the most influential and critically acclaimed rock albums in history, appearing at number thirteen on <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time as well as being added to the 2006 National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground_%26_Nico' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2013-10-28 11:30:14 -0400 -->
