		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 05 February 2014 </h1><h2> List of poker hand nicknames</h2><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hand_nicknames' >More...</a><hr><h2> Cher Ami</h2><p><b>Cher Ami</b> (French for "dear friend", in the masculine) was a homing pigeon which had been donated by the pigeon fanciers of Britain for use by the U.S. Army Signal Corps in France during World War I and had been trained by American pigeoneers. She helped save the Lost Battalion of the 77th Division in the Battle of the Argonne, October 1918.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher_Ami' >More...</a><hr><h2> Delay certificate</h2><p>A <b>delay certificate</b> (電車遅延証明書, <i>densha chien shoumei sho</i><sup>?</sup>, <i>lit</i> certificate of lateness or <i><b>Bescheinigung über Zugverspätung</b></i>, literally <i>certificate about train delay</i>) is a documentation of proof issued by a railway company that its scheduled passenger train arrived at a station later than what is stipulated in the company's scheduled timetable.</p>
<p>This practice is only prevalent in private and public Japanese railway companies and Germany's Deutsche Bahn, where a well-established reputation for its trains' punctuality exists and its passengers take for granted that they always operate on time. Parisian RATP also issues such certificates under the name "bulletin de retard" if the delay is greater than 15 minutes. They can be used for example for late admission at university exams. In addition, a few bus companies in Japan have also adopted this practice.</p>
<p>The certificate is issued when delays as little as five minutes occur, and even for instances where the delay is caused by circumstances beyond the railway company's control (e.g. foul weather, person under train). Handwritten certificates or printouts given out (generally in 10 × 15 cm strips) by conductors or station staff can be collected by passengers affected by lateness or delay, who can then produce it to their superiors at school or work and considered as a valid reason for reporting late.</p>
<p>Major Japanese railway companies such as JR East, Tokyu Corporation and Tokyo Metro have introduced electronic versions of the delay certificates on their websites, which would remain there for a week or less. Affected passengers who were unable to or did not collect the certificate could alternatively access and download it into their mobile phones or computers, and print them out if necessary.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_certificate' >More...</a><hr><h2> Bill Gates</h2><p><b>William Henry "Bill" Gates III</b> (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, programmer, inventor and philanthropist. Gates is the former chief executive and chairman of Microsoft, the world’s largest personal-computer software company, which he co-founded with Paul Allen.</p>
<p>He is consistently ranked in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people and was the wealthiest overall from 1995 to 2009—excluding 2008, when he was ranked third; in 2011 he was the wealthiest American and the world's second wealthiest person. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires List, Gates is the world's richest person in 2013, a position that he last held on the list in 2007.</p>
<p>During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of CEO and chief software architect, and remains the largest individual shareholder, with 6.4 percent of the common stock. He has also authored and co-authored several books.</p>
<p>Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. Gates has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive, an opinion which has in some cases been upheld by the courts. In the later stages of his career, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, established in 2000.</p>
<p>Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000. He remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work, and full-time work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie, chief software architect, and Craig Mundie, chief research and strategy officer. Gates's last full-time day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014, taking on a new post as technology advisor to support newly-appointed CEO Satya Nadella.</p>

Both the Olympics and 2014 Winter Paralympics are being organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee (SOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. The Sochi Olympics will be the first Olympics in the Russian Federation since the breakup of the USSR in 1991. The USSR was the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.</p>
<p>98 events in 15 winter sport disciplines will be held throughout the Games. A number of new competitions—a total of twelve accounting for gender—will be held during the Games, including biathlon mixed relay, women's ski jumping, mixed-team figure skating, mixed-team luge, half-pipe skiing, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and snowboard parallel slalom. The events will be held around two clusters of new venues; an Olympic Park was constructed in Sochi's Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea, with Fisht Olympic Stadium and the Games' indoor venues located within walking distance, and snow events will be held at Krasnaya Polyana. In all, there are 11 venues having a seat capacity of around 120,000. In fact, the Sochi 2014 Games will be the most compact in the entire history of the hosting of the Winter Olympic Games.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p>Over 2800 athletes from a record 88 nations will compete at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, the highest ever participation beating the record of 2010 Vancouver Winter Games where 2,566 athletes 82 nations participated.</p>
<p>In preparation for the games, organizers focused on modernizing the telecommunications, electric power, and transportation infrastructures of the region. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to over US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing as the most expensive Olympics in history.</p>
<p>The lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics was marked by several major controversies, including allegations of corruption leading to the aforementioned cost overruns, concerns from politicians and athletes over the effects of the country's ban on the promotion of homosexuality to minors (which led to ongoing protests), and various security concerns over threats by a jihadist group.</p>

He is best known as the host of the Disney/PBS children's science show <i>Bill Nye the Science Guy</i> (1993–98) and for his many subsequent appearances in popular media as a science educator.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nye' >More...</a><hr><h2> Old Tjikko</h2><p><b>Old Tjikko</b> is a 9,550-year-old Norway Spruce tree, located on Fulufjället Mountain of Dalarna province in Sweden. Old Tjikko is the world's oldest known living individual clonal tree. However, there are many examples of much older clonal colonies (multiple trees connected by a common root system), such as "Pando", estimated to be over 80,000 years old.</p>
<p>The age of the tree was determined by carbon dating of the root system under the tree, not by dendrochronology, or counting tree rings. The trunk itself is estimated to be only a few hundred years old, but the tree as a whole may have survived for much longer due to a process known as layering (when a branch comes in contact with the ground, it sprouts a new root), or vegetative cloning (when the trunk dies but the root system is still alive, it may sprout a new trunk).</p>
<p>The oldest living non-clonal tree, verified by dendrochronology, is 5064 years old as of 2014 (the former record was held by "Methuselah" (4847)). Both trees are Great Basin Bristlecone Pine located in California. Vegetative cloning and reproduction is common in many plants, such as the creosote bush (see "King Clone", estimated from growth rate to be almost 12,000 years old). Many other plants also may take advantage of this process either exclusively or in tandem with sexual reproduction, but dating or estimating the age of these organisms may not be possible without evidence (e.g., old roots, ancient remains, consistent growth rates).</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Tjikko' >More...</a><hr><h2> Teamwork</h2><p><b>Teamwork</b> is "work done by several associates with each doing a part but all subordinating personal prominence to the efficiency of the whole" .</p>
<p>In a business setting accounting techniques may be used to provide financial measures of the benefits of teamwork which are useful for justifying the concept. Teamwork is increasingly advocated by health care policy makers as a means of assuring quality and safety in the delivery of services; a committee of the Institute of Medicine recommended in 2000 that patient safety programs "establish interdisciplinary team training programs for providers that incorporate proven methods of team training, such as simulation."</p>
<p>In health care, a systematic concept analysis in 2008 concluded teamwork to be "a dynamic process involving two or more healthcare professionals with complementary backgrounds and skills, sharing common health goals and exercising concerted physical and mental effort in assessing, planning, or evaluating patient care." Elsewhere teamwork is defined as "those behaviours that facilitate effective team member interaction," with "team" defined as "a group of two or more individuals who perform some work related task, interact with one another dynamically, have a shared past, have a foreseeable shared future, and share a common fate." Another definition for teamwork proposed in 2008 is "the interdependent components of performance required to effectively coordinate the performance of multiple individuals"; as such, teamwork is "nested within" the broader concept of team performance which also includes individual-level taskwork. A 2012 review of the academic literature found that the word "teamwork" has been used "as a catchall to refer to a number of behavioral processes and emergent states."</p>
