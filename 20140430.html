		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 30 April 2014 </h1><h2> Financial endowment</h2><p>A <b>financial endowment</b> is a proper donation of money or property to an institution. The total value of an institution's investments is often referred to as the institution's endowment and is typically organized as a public charity, private foundation, or trust.</p>
<p>Among the institutions that commonly manage endowments are academic institutions (e.g., colleges, universities, and private schools), cultural institutions (e.g., museums, libraries, theaters, and hospitals), and religious establishments.</p>
<p>An endowment may come with stipulations regarding its usage. In some circumstances, an endowment may be required to be spent in a certain way or alternatively to be invested, with the principal to remain intact in perpetuity or for a defined period, which allows for the donation to have an impact over a longer period than if it were spent all at once.</p>

Ronaldo's contract with Real Madrid, under the terms of which he is paid €21 million per year (after taxes), makes him the highest-paid footballer in the world, and his buyout clause is valued at €1 billion as per his contract.</p>
<p>Ronaldo began his career as a youth player for Andorinha, where he played for two years, before moving to C.D. Nacional. In 1997, he made a move to Portuguese giants Sporting Clube de Portugal. Ronaldo caught the attention of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who signed him for £12.24 million (€15 million) in 2003. In 2004, Ronaldo won his first club honour, the FA Cup.</p>
<p>Ronaldo was the first player playing in England to win all four main PFA and FWA awards, doing so in 2007.

He also holds the record for most goals scored in a season for Real Madrid. In January 2014, Ronaldo scored his 400th career goal. After spending his first year at Madrid wearing the number 9 shirt, he began wearing the number 7 again following the departure of long-serving striker Raúl. Ronaldo had previously worn the number 7 shirt at Manchester United.</p>
