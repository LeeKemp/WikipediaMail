		<h1>Popular Pages - Sunday 09 March 2014 </h1><h2> The Sum of All Fears (film)</h2><p><i><b>The Sum of All Fears</b></i> is a 2002 American action political thriller film directed by Phil Alden Robinson, based on Tom Clancy's novel of the same name. This fourth film in the Jack Ryan film series is a reboot set in 2002, with Ryan portrayed as younger than in the 1990 film <i>The Hunt for Red October</i> (set in 1984) starring Alec Baldwin, and in that film's sequels, <i>Patriot Games</i> and <i>Clear and Present Danger</i>, both of which starred Harrison Ford.</p>
<p>The film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of Paramount Pictures, Mace Neufeld Productions, MFP Munich Film Partners, and S.O.A.F. Productions. On June 4, 2002, the original motion picture soundtrack was released by the Elektra Records music label. The soundtrack was composed and orchestrated by musician Jerry Goldsmith.</p>
<p>The film premiered in theaters in the United States on May 31, 2002 grossing $118,907,036 in box office revenue. Its worldwide theatrical run ended with a total of $193,921,372 in business. Considering its production budget of $68 million and related marketing costs, the film was considered a major financial success. It presently holds a 59% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with generally mixed critical reviews.</p>

A pachinko machine resembles a vertical pinball machine, but has no flippers and uses a large number of small balls. The player fires balls into the machine, which then cascade down through a dense forest of pins. If the balls go into certain locations, they may be captured and sequences of events may be triggered that result in more balls being released. The object of the game is to capture as many balls as possible. These balls can then be exchanged for prizes. Pachinko machines were originally strictly mechanical, but modern ones have incorporated extensive electronics, becoming similar to video slot machines.</p>
<p>Pachinko parlors are widespread in Japan, and they usually also feature a number of slot machines (called <i>pachislo</i> or pachislots); hence, these venues operate and look similar to casinos.</p>
<p>Modern pachinko machines are highly customizable, keeping enthusiasts continuously entertained.</p>
<p>Gambling for cash is illegal in Japan. Balls won cannot be exchanged directly for money in the parlor. The balls are exchanged for tokens or prizes, which are then taken outside and exchanged for cash at a place nominally separate from the parlor.</p>

It was once classified in the lily family, like its <i>Allium</i> cousins, onions and garlic, but the Liliaceae have been split and the onion-like plants are now in the family Amaryllidaceae and asparagus in the Asparagaceae. <i>Asparagus officinalis</i> is native to most of Europe, northern Africa and western Asia, and is widely cultivated as a vegetable crop.</p>

He is a cultural icon of teenage disillusionment, as expressed in the title of his most celebrated film, <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i> (1955), in which he starred as troubled Los Angeles teenager, Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his stardom were as loner Cal Trask in <i>East of Eden</i> (1955), and as surly ranch hand Jett Rink in <i>Giant</i> (1956). Dean's enduring fame and popularity rest on his performances in only these three films, all leading roles. His premature death in a car crash cemented his legendary status.</p>
<p>Dean was the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and remains the only actor to have had two posthumous acting nominations. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him the 18th best male movie star on their AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars list.</p>

The popularity of tea occasioned the furtive export of slips, a small shoot for planting or twig for grafting to tea plants, from China to British India and its commercial culture there, beginning in 1840; British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent. Tea, which was an upper-class drink in Europe, became the infusion of every class in Great Britain in the course of the 18th century and has remained so.</p>
<p>In Britain, the drinking of tea is so varied that it is quite hard to generalise, but usually it is served with milk and sometimes with lemon. Strong tea can be served with milk and occasionally one or two teaspoons of sugar in a mug, and is commonly referred to as <i>builder's tea</i>. The expression "cream tea" does not refer to cream mixed into the beverage but to a meal in which tea is taken along with scones and clotted cream, and usually strawberry jam as well. (This tradition originated from Devon and Cornwall.)</p>
<p>Much of the time in the United Kingdom, tea drinking is not the delicate, refined cultural expression that some might imagine: a cup (or commonly a mug) of tea is something drunk often.</p>

The property and mansion have been claimed to be haunted—including by Winchester herself—since construction commenced in 1884. Under Winchester's day-to-day guidance, its "from-the-ground-up" construction proceeded around the clock, without interruption, until her death on September 5, 1922, at which time work immediately ceased. The cost for such constant building has been estimated at about US $5.5 million (equivalent to over $75 million in 2012). It now serves as a tourist attraction.</p>
<p>Though it is possible Sarah Winchester was simply seeking a change of location and a hobby during her lengthy depression, other sources claim that while consulting The Boston Medium, Winchester came to believe her family and fortune were haunted by the ghosts of people who had fallen victim to Winchester rifles, and that only by moving West and continuously building them a house could she appease these spirits. Located at 525 South Winchester Blvd. in San Jose, California, the Queen Anne Style Victorian mansion is renowned for its size and utter lack of any master building plan.</p>

He was one of the founding members of the Wu-Tang Clan, a rap group primarily from Staten Island, New York that first rose to mainstream prominence with their 1993 debut album <i>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</i>.</p>
<p>After establishing the Wu-Tang Clan, Ol' Dirty Bastard went on to pursue a successful solo career and contributed as a rapper/producer for the Fugees. However, his professional success was hampered by frequent legal troubles, including incarceration. He died on November 13, 2004 of a drug overdose, two days before his 36th birthday. Prior to his death, Jones managed to record his third solo album, which remains unreleased.</p>
<p>Jones was often noted for his trademark microphone techniques and his "outrageously profane, free-associative rhymes delivered in a distinctive half-rapped, half-sung style". His stage name was derived from the 1980 martial arts film <i>Ol' Dirty and the Bastard</i> (also called <i>An Old Kung Fu Master</i>, starring Simon "Ol' Dirty" Yuen); Method Man articulated its relevance on track 5 of <i>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</i>, stating there was "no father to his style".</p>
