		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 26 February 2014 </h1><h2> One World Futbol</h2><p>The <b>One World Football</b> is a soccer ball that is designed to be very difficult to destroy. It is made with a specialized foam, related to the material used to make Crocs shoes, that allows the ball to re-inflate after being punctured. The One World Football Project, which manufactures and distributes the One World Football, was founded in California in 2010 to manufacture, sell, and donate the balls.</p>
<p>The company has produced about 33,000 balls.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>when?</i>]</sup> About half of them were bought for $40 each; for each ball purchased, another is given away. The ball has been spread by numerous organizations and made its way to over 140 countries.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Futbol' >More...</a><hr><h2> The Trillion Dollar Campaign</h2><p><i><b>The Trillion Dollar Campaign</b></i> is an outdoor advertising campaign launched in 2009 to promote the newspaper <i>The Zimbabwean</i> in South Africa. The campaign was created by advertising agency TBWA Hunt Lascaris with the goal of both increasing awareness of the newspaper itself, and of the growing problems of hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and increasing restrictions on free speech by the government. <i>The Trillion Dollar Campaign</i> made extensive use of Zimbabwean banknotes, repurposing them as printing paper for handouts, billboards, and poster advertisements. The campaign was highly successful, and gathered significant publicity; first in other South African newspapers, then in other media such as television and radio, and finally in international publications such as <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>The Times</i>. <i>The Trillion Dollar Campaign</i> went on to win several honours from the marketing community, receiving Golds at The Art Directors Club Awards and the ANDY Awards, and taking home the Grand Prix in the Outdoor category of the 2009 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the most prestigious awards ceremony in the advertising industry.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trillion_Dollar_Campaign' >More...</a><hr><h2> Bitcoin</h2><p><b>Bitcoin</b> is a peer-to-peer payment system and digital currency introduced as open source software in 2009 by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a cryptocurrency, so-called because it uses cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money. Conventionally, the capitalized word "Bitcoin" refers to the technology and network, whereas lowercase "bitcoins" refers to the currency itself.</p>
<p>Bitcoins are created by a process called mining, in which participants verify and record payments in exchange for transaction fees and newly minted bitcoins. Users send and receive bitcoins using wallet software on a personal computer, mobile device, or a web application. Bitcoins can be obtained by mining or in exchange for products, services, or other currencies.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has been a subject of scrutiny due to ties with illicit activity. In 2013 the U.S. FBI shut down the Silk Road online black market and seized 144,000 bitcoins worth US$28.5 million at the time. The U.S. is considered Bitcoin-friendly compared to other governments, however. In China new rules restrict bitcoin exchange for local currency. The European Banking Authority has warned that Bitcoin lacks consumer protections. Bitcoins can be stolen and chargebacks are impossible.</p>
<p>Commercial use of Bitcoin, illicit or otherwise, is currently small compared to its use by speculators, which has fueled price volatility. Bitcoin as a form of payment for products and services has seen growth, however, and merchants have an incentive to accept the currency because transaction fees are lower than the 2–3% typically imposed by credit card processors.</p>

The film retells the origin of Godzilla in contemporary times as a "terrifying force of nature". The film is directed by British filmmaker Gareth Edwards, written by Max Borenstein and stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, David Strathairn, Sally Hawkins, and Ken Watanabe.</p>
<p>The film is a co-production of Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures and will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures worldwide, except for Japan where it will be distributed by Toho. It is the second <i>Godzilla</i> film to be fully filmed by an American studio, the first having been the 1998 film of the same name. The film is scheduled to be released on May 16, 2014 in 2D and 3D.</p>

There are two primary hypotheses: one proposes that syphilis was carried from the Americas to Europe by the crew of Christopher Columbus, the other proposes that syphilis previously existed in Europe but went unrecognized. These are referred to as the "Columbian" and "pre-Columbian" hypotheses respectively.</p>
<p>In late 2011 newly published evidence suggested that the Columbian hypothesis is the valid one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Skeletal evidence that reputedly showed signs of syphilis in Europe and other parts of the Old World before Christopher Columbus made his voyage in 1492 does not hold up when subjected to standardized analyses for diagnosis and dating, according to an appraisal in the current Yearbook of Physical Anthropology. This is the first time that all 54 previously published cases have been evaluated systematically, and bolsters the case that syphilis came from the New World."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first written records of an outbreak of syphilis in Europe occurred in 1494/1495 in Naples, Italy, during a French invasion. Because it was spread by returning French troops, the disease was known as "French disease", and it was not until 1530 that the term "syphilis" was first applied by the Italian physician and poet Girolamo Fracastoro. The causative organism, <i>Treponema pallidum</i>, was first identified by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann in 1905. The first effective treatment (Salvarsan) was developed in 1910 by Paul Ehrlich which was followed by the introduction of penicillin in 1943. Many famous historical figures including Franz Schubert, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Édouard Manet are believed to have had the disease.</p>

Cases of wrongful execution are cited as an argument by opponents of capital punishment.</p>
<p>A number of people are claimed to have been innocent victims of the death penalty. Newly available DNA evidence has allowed the exoneration and release of more than 15 death row inmates since 1992 in the United States, but DNA evidence is available in only a fraction of capital cases. Others have been released on the basis of weak cases against them, sometimes involving prosecutorial misconduct; resulting in acquittal at retrial, charges dropped, or innocence-based pardons. The Death Penalty Information Center (U.S.) has published a list of 10 inmates "executed but possibly innocent". At least 39 executions are claimed to have been carried out in the U.S. in the face of evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt.</p>
<p>In the UK, reviews prompted by the Criminal Cases Review Commission have resulted in one pardon and three exonerations for people executed between 1950 and 1953 (when the execution rate in England and Wales averaged 17 per year), with compensation being paid.</p>
