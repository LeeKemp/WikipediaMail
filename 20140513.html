		<h1>Popular Pages - Tuesday 13 May 2014 </h1><h2> Solange Knowles</h2><p><b>Solange Piaget Knowles</b> (born June 24, 1986) is an American singer, songwriter, and model. Knowles was born in Houston, Texas to Matthew and Tina Knowles, both of whom left their careers to support her older sister Beyoncé's recording interests. Expressing an interest in music from an early age, Knowles had several temporary stints in Destiny's Child, before signing with her father's Music World Entertainment label. Aged sixteen, Knowles released her first studio album <i>Solo Star</i> (2003) to moderate commercial and critical success.</p>
<p>In 2004, Knowles married Daniel Smith, eventually giving birth to their son Daniel Julez J. Smith Jr., which prompted a move to Idaho. Between 2005 and 2007, Knowles had several minor acting roles, including the direct-to-video <i>Bring It On: All or Nothing</i> (2006) and continued writing music for Beyoncé and ex-Destiny Child band members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. In 2007, Knowles divorced Smith and moved to Los Angeles, California, beginning to write and record music again. Her second studio album <i>Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams</i> (2008) deviated from the pop-oriented music of her debut to the Motown Sound of the 1960s and 70s. It peaked at number 9 on the <i>Billboard 200</i> and received positive reviews from critics. She followed this up with the 1980s pop/R&amp;B-inspired extended play <i>True</i> (2012) and intends to release her third studio album in 2014, on her own label Saint Records.</p>
<p>Knowles is heavily influenced by Motown girl groups and says that her first passion is songwriting. She has been recognised as a fashion icon and has received frequent comparisons to sister Beyoncé from the media, although insists they have different aspirations and are musically different. Her other ventures include an endorsement deal with Rimmel London and a line of hip-hop-oriented merchandise for young children, which was inspired by her son.</p>

She was the first sister of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and longtime Senator Ted Kennedy. Considered psychologically unstable by her family, she underwent a prefrontal lobotomy at age 23, which left her permanently incapacitated.</p>

He is known as <b>Rama IX</b>. Having reigned since 9 June 1946, he is the world's longest-serving current head of state and the longest-reigning monarch in Thai history, having served for 700167000000000000067 years, 7002337000000000000337 days.</p>
<p>King Bhumibol is respected and revered by many Thais. The King is legally considered "inviolable", and <i>lèse majesté</i>, that is, offence against the dignity of the monarch, may be punished. In 1957, the overthrow of the government was justified with allegations of <i>lèse majesté</i>. Although Bhumibol invited public criticism in a 2005 speech, politicians and individuals are still being arrested, though most are pardoned.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p><i>Forbes</i> estimated Bhumibol's personal fortune, including property and investments—managed by the Crown Property Bureau (CPB), a unique body that is neither private nor government-owned—to be US$30 billion in 2010, and he was the leader of the magazine's list of "The World's Richest Royals" from 2008 to 2013. In May 2014, Bhumibol's wealth was once again listed as US$30 billion. The estimation of Bhumibol's wealth includes land that the royal family denies ownership of, and royal courtiers insisted in 2012 that the CPB's assets belong to the crown, rather than the king.</p>

In cancer, cells divide and grow uncontrollably, forming malignant tumors, which may invade nearby parts of the body. The cancer may also spread to more distant parts of the body through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not invade neighboring tissues and do not spread throughout the body. There are over 200 different known cancers that affect humans.</p>
<p>The causes of cancer are diverse, complex, and only partially understood. Many things are known to increase the risk of cancer, including tobacco use, dietary factors, certain infections, exposure to radiation, lack of physical activity, obesity, and environmental pollutants. These factors can directly damage genes or combine with existing genetic faults within cells to cause cancerous mutations. Approximately 5–10% of cancers can be traced directly to inherited genetic defects. Many cancers could be prevented by not smoking, eating more vegetables, fruits and whole grains, eating less meat and refined carbohydrates, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising, minimizing sunlight exposure, and being vaccinated against some infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Cancer can be detected in a number of ways, including the presence of certain signs and symptoms, screening tests, or medical imaging. Once a possible cancer is detected it is diagnosed by microscopic examination of a tissue sample. Cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. The chances of surviving the disease vary greatly by the type and location of the cancer and the extent of disease at the start of treatment. While cancer can affect people of all ages, and a few types of cancer are more common in children, the risk of developing cancer generally increases with age. In 2007, cancer caused about 13% of all human deaths worldwide (7.9 million). Rates are rising as more people live to an old age and as mass lifestyle changes occur in the developing world.</p>
