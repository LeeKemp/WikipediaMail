		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 14 May 2014 </h1><h2> Enron scandal</h2><p>The <b>Enron scandal</b>, revealed in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, and the de facto dissolution of Arthur Andersen, which was one of the five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world. In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history at that time, Enron was attributed as the biggest audit failure.</p>
<p>Enron was formed in 1985 by Kenneth Lay after merging Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, he developed a staff of executives that, by the use of accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting, were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Andersen to ignore the issues.</p>
<p>Enron shareholders filed a $40 billion lawsuit after the company's stock price, which achieved a high of US$90.75 per share in mid-2000, plummeted to less than $1 by the end of November 2001. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation, and rival Houston competitor Dynegy offered to purchase the company at a very low price. The deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Enron's $63.4 billion in assets made it the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history until WorldCom's bankruptcy the next year.</p>
<p>Many executives at Enron were indicted for a variety of charges and were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty in a United States District Court, but by the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had closed. Employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices. As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.</p>

Because they were often worn by people involved in accounting, auditing, economics, and budgeting, they became associated with these activities. The phrase "green eye-shades" can be applied derogatorily to individuals who are excessively concerned with financial matters or small and insignificant details.</p>
<p>Green eyeshades were often made of a transparent dark green or blue-green colored celluloid, although leather and paper were used to make the visor portion as well. One manufacturer, The Featherweight Eyeshade Company, described their eyeshade as "restful" to the eyes. Eyeshades were sold through office supply stores through the 1950s.</p>
<p>Several individuals, including one William Mahoney, received patents for their eyeshade designs. Author Carl Sandburg wore a green eyeshade, which is on display at his former residence of Connemara at Flat Rock, North Carolina. The Society of Professional Journalists annually recognizes deserving journalists working in the Southern United States with its <i>Green Eyeshade Excellence in Journalism Award</i>. Green eyeshades are still on the market, typically sold as "dealer's visors." They retain a certain degree of popularity in the gambling community.</p>
<p>The gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson popularized the headgear for a new generation of readers. His green eyeshade was common alongside his cigarette holder, amber sunglasses, Hawaiian shirts, and Bermuda shorts and may be seen in the films <i>Where the Buffalo Roam</i> and <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_eyeshade' >More...</a><hr><h2> Sean Connery</h2><p><b>Sir Thomas Sean Connery</b> Kt.

DeMille Award and a Henrietta Award). He was knighted by Elizabeth II in July 2000, and received the Kennedy Center Honors in the US.</p>

<p>Connery has been polled as "The Greatest Living Scot" and "Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure". In 1989, he was proclaimed "Sexiest Man Alive" by <i>People</i> magazine and in 1999, at age 69, he was voted "Sexiest Man of the Century".<br></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Connery' >More...</a><hr><h2> Soulja Boy Tell 'Em</h2><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulja_Boy_Tell_%27Em' >More...</a><hr><h2> Ralph Waite</h2><p><b>Ralph Waite</b> (June 22, 1928 – February 13, 2014) was an American actor.

Its name comes from a colloquialism for the directory given to students at some American universities. Facebook was founded on February 4, 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities before it opened to high-school students, and eventually to anyone aged 13 and over. Facebook now allows anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old to become a registered user of the website.</p>
<p>Users must register before using the site, after which they may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, exchange messages, and receive automatic notifications when they update their profile. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". In September 2012, Facebook had over one billion active users, of which approximately 9% were fake. In 2012, Facebook was adding over half a petabyte of data every 24 hours, amounting to about 180 petabytes per year.</p>
