Hector, or sometimes "Hector the Convector", is known as one of the world's most consistently large thunderstorms, reaching heights of approximately 20 kilometres (66,000 ft).</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_(cloud)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Goblin shark</h2><p>The <b>goblin shark</b> (<i>Mitsukurina owstoni</i>) is a rare, poorly understood species of deep-sea shark. Sometimes called a "living fossil", it is the only extant representative of the family Mitsukurinidae, a lineage some 125 million years old. This pink-skinned animal has a distinctive profile with an elongated, flattened snout, and highly protrusible jaws containing prominent nail-like teeth. It is usually between 3 and 4 m (10 and 13 ft) long when mature, though it can grow considerably larger. Goblin sharks inhabit upper continental slopes, submarine canyons, and seamounts throughout the world at depths greater than 100 m (330 ft), with adults found deeper than juveniles.</p>
<p>Various anatomical features of the goblin shark, such as its flabby body and small fins, suggest that it is sluggish in nature. This species hunts for teleost fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans both near the sea floor and in the middle of the water column. Its long snout is covered with ampullae of Lorenzini that enable it to sense minute electric fields produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. Small numbers of goblin sharks are unintentionally caught by deepwater fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_shark' >More...</a><hr><h2> 24 (TV series)</h2><p><i><b>24</b></i> is an American television series produced for the Fox network and syndicated worldwide, starring Kiefer Sutherland as Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) agent Jack Bauer. Each 24-episode season covers 24 hours in the life of Bauer, using the real time method of narration. Premiering on November 6, 2001, the show spanned 192 episodes over eight seasons, with the series finale broadcast on May 24, 2010. In addition, a television film, <i>24: Redemption</i>, was broadcast between seasons six and seven. Fox announced in May 2013 that <i>24</i> would return as a 12-episode series titled <i>24: Live Another Day</i> which debuted on May 5, 2014.</p>
<p>Bauer is the only character to have appeared in every episode of the series. The series begins with his working for the Los Angeles–based Counter Terrorist Unit, in which he is a highly proficient agent with an "ends justify the means" approach, regardless of the perceived morality of some of his actions. Throughout the series most of the main plot elements unfold like a political thriller. A typical plot has Bauer racing against the clock as he attempts to thwart multiple terrorist plots, including presidential assassination attempts, weapons of mass destruction detonations, cyber attacks, as well as conspiracies which deal with government and corporate corruption.</p>
<p><i>24</i> garnered critical acclaim, winning numerous awards over its eight seasons, including Best Drama Series at the 2003 Golden Globe Awards and Outstanding Drama Series at the 2006 Primetime Emmy Awards. Nevertheless, the series has been criticized for its depictions of torture as effective and its negative depictions of Muslims. At the conclusion of its eighth and final season, <i>24</i> became the longest-running espionage-themed television drama ever, surpassing both <i>Mission: Impossible</i> and <i>The Avengers</i>.</p>

<p>Selby, who began his professional snooker career in 1998 at the age of 15, was runner-up to John Higgins at the 2007 World Snooker Championship. After winning three Masters titles in 2008, 2010, and 2013, the UK Championship in 2012, and the World Championship in 2014, he became the ninth player to win all of snooker's Triple Crown events at least once. His other ranking titles include the Welsh Open in 2008 and the Shanghai Masters in 2011. Selby is also a former world number one and will regain the ranking at the beginning of the 2014/2015 season as a result of winning the world title. His nickname, "The Jester from Leicester", was given to him by snooker compere Richard Beare.</p>
<p>Selby is also a pool player, and is the 2006 WEPF World Eight-ball Champion.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Selby' >More...</a><hr><h2> State Opening of Parliament</h2><p>The <b>State Opening of Parliament</b> is an event in the United Kingdom that marks the commencement of a session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and includes a Speech from the Throne. In many other countries, a similar speech from the throne is given by their head of state to their national legislature at or near the opening of a new legislative session. In Commonwealth nations that recognize Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State, the Governor-General of the nation gives the Speech from the Throne as the Queen's representative.</p>
<p>The State Opening takes place in the House of Lords Chamber and, before 2011, was usually held in November or December or, in a general election year, when the new Parliament first assembled. In 1974, when two general elections were held, there were two State Openings.</p>
<p>However, from 2012 onwards, the ceremony takes place in May. This is owing to the introduction in 2011 of fixed-term parliaments of five years in length, with parliamentary elections being subsequently held in the May of every year divisible by five, with the next such election being scheduled for 2015. The 2012 ceremony took place on 9 May and the 2013 date was 8 May.</p>
<p>The current Sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II, has opened every session of the Westminster Parliament since her accession, except in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, respectively. These two sessions were opened by Lords Commissioners, headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (Geoffrey Fisher in 1959, and Michael Ramsey in 1963), empowered by Her Majesty. The Lord Chancellor (The Viscount Kilmuir in 1959, The Lord Dilhorne in 1963) read the Queen's Speech on those occasions.</p>

</dl><p>In Greek mythology, <b>Priapus</b> or <b>Priapos</b> (Ancient Greek: Πρίαπος), was a minor rustic fertility god, protector of livestock, fruit plants, gardens and male genitalia. Priapus is marked by his absurdly oversized, permanent erection, which gave rise to the medical term priapism. He became a popular figure in Roman erotic art and Latin literature, and is the subject of the often humorously obscene collection of verse called the <i>Priapeia</i>.</p>
