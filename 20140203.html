Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, by a family of musicians, Mars began making music at a young age and performed in various musical venues in his hometown throughout his childhood. He graduated from high school and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career. Mars produced songs for other artists, joining production team The Smeezingtons.</p>
<p>Mars had an unsuccessful stint with Motown Records, but then signed with Atlantic in 2009. He became recognized as a solo artist after lending his vocals to the songs "Nothin' on You" by B.o.B, and "Billionaire" by Travie McCoy, which were worldwide successes, and for which he co-wrote the hooks. He also co-wrote the songs "Right Round" by Flo Rida featuring Ke$ha, and "Wavin' Flag" by K'naan, allowing him to work with an assortment of artists from various genres. Mars' debut studio album, <i>Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans</i> (2010), peaked at number three on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, anchored by the worldwide number-one singles "Just the Way You Are" and "Grenade", as well as by the single "The Lazy Song". The album was nominated for seven Grammy Awards, winning Best Pop Vocal Performance for "Just The Way You Are". His second album, <i>Unorthodox Jukebox</i> (2012), peaked at number one in the United States. The album spawned the international singles "Locked Out of Heaven", "When I Was Your Man" and the moderate success "Treasure".</p>
<p>He has sold 10 million albums during his 3-year singing career and 58 million singles worldwide. His combined downloaded works as a singer, songwriter, and producer total over $115 million . As a solo artist he has had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and seven top-ten singles, only the second artist to do so after Richard Marx. "Just the Way You Are" sold 12.5 million copies and contributed to Mars becoming the best-selling digital artist in 2011. In 2011, Mars was named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. In 2014, he was ranked number one on the Forbes 30 under 30 list.</p>

Wilson was selected by the Seahawks with the 12th pick in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft.</p>
<p>Wilson played college football for the University of Wisconsin during the 2011 season, in which he set the single season FBS record for passing efficiency (191.8) and led the team to a Big Ten title and the 2012 Rose Bowl. Wilson received the Big Ten Quarterback of the Year award and was named a consensus first-team All-Big Ten and third-team All-American by Yahoo! Sports.</p>
<p>Wilson played football and baseball for North Carolina State University before transferring to Wisconsin. In 2008, he was named the ACC Rookie of the Year in football and became the first freshman quarterback to receive first team All-ACC honors. Wilson also played minor league baseball for the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2010 and the Asheville Tourists in 2011 as a second baseman.</p>
<p>Wilson signed a four-year, $2.99 million contract with the Seattle Seahawks on May 7, 2012 and was named the team's starting quarterback on August 26, 2012. In 2012, Wilson led the Seahawks to the divisional round of the NFL playoffs and was voted the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year. Following the 2013 season, Wilson led the Seahawks to their first Super Bowl win in the team's 38-year history.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson' >More...</a><hr><h2> Peyton Manning</h2><p><b>Peyton Williams Manning</b> (born March 24, 1976) is an American football quarterback for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). A five-time MVP, he played for the Indianapolis Colts for 14 seasons from 1998 to 2011. He is a son of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and an elder brother of New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning.</p>
<p>Manning played college football for the University of Tennessee, leading the Volunteers to the 1997 SEC Championship in his senior season. However, No. 3 Tennessee lost to the No. 2 Nebraska Cornhuskers 42-17 in the Orange Bowl giving Nebraska and Tom Osborne their 3rd national championship in 4 years. He was chosen by the Indianapolis Colts with the first overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft. Manning's playing career and statistics have ranked him among the greatest quarterbacks of all-time. From 1998 to 2010, he led the Colts to eight (seven AFC South and one AFC East) division championships, two AFC championships, and one Super Bowl championship (Super Bowl XLI). His five NFL MVPs are a league record, he was the most valuable player of Super Bowl XLI, has been named to thirteen Pro Bowls, has thirteen 4,000-yard passing seasons, and is the Indianapolis Colts' all-time leader in passing yards (54,828) and touchdown passes (399). In 2009, he was named the best player in the NFL, and Fox Sports, along with <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, named him the NFL player of the decade for the 2000s. Before the 2013 season had even finished SI had named him their Sportsman of the Year.</p>
<p>In May 2011, he underwent neck surgery to alleviate neck pain and arm weakness he dealt with during the previous few seasons before signing a five-year, $90 million contract extension with the Colts in July 2011. Manning had hoped to play in the 2011 season, but in September 2011 he underwent a second, and much more serious surgery: a level one cervical fusion procedure. Manning had never missed an NFL game in his career, but was forced to miss the entire 2011 season. He was released by the Colts on March 7, 2012, and after an almost two-week period where he visited with and worked out for several NFL teams, he signed with the Denver Broncos on March 20, 2012.</p>
<p>Manning's pre-snap routine has earned him the nickname "The Sheriff", and he is one of the most recognizable and parodied players in the NFL. Teams led by Manning more often than not use the hurry-up offense in place of the standard huddle.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning' >More...</a><hr><h2> List of Super Bowl champions</h2><p>The <b>Super Bowl</b> is an annual American football game that determines the <b>champion of the National Football League (NFL)</b>. The contest is held in an American city that is chosen three to four years beforehand, usually in warm-weather or domed sites. Since 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs. Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in four such contests. The first two were known as the "AFL-NFL World Championship Game." Super Bowl III in 1969 was the first such game that carried the "Super Bowl" moniker, the names "Super Bowl I" and "Super Bowl II" were retroactively applied to the first two games. The NFC/NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 26, while the AFC/AFL has won 22. Nineteen different franchises, including teams that relocated to another city, have won the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have won the most Super Bowls with six championships (record 6â€“2), while both the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers have five wins each (Cowboys 5â€“3; 49ers 5â€“1). Dallas and Pittsburgh have the most Super Bowl appearances with eight, while the Buffalo Bills have the most consecutive appearances with four losses in a row from 1990 to 1993 (the Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have three consecutive appearances: 1972-74). The Denver Broncos have lost a record five Super Bowls. The New England Patriots and Minnesota Vikings have lost four. Buffalo and Minnesota are both 0â€“4, Denver is 2â€“5 and New England is 3â€“4. The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises: the 1966-67 Green Bay Packers, the 1972-73 Miami Dolphins, the 1974-75 and 1978-79 Pittsburgh Steelers (the only team to accomplish this feat twice), the 1988-89 San Francisco 49ers, the 1992-93 Dallas Cowboys, the 1997-98 Denver Broncos, and the 2003-04 New England Patriots. The 1972 Dolphins' win capped off the only perfect season in NFL history. The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens, who in winning Super Bowl XLVII unseated and replaced the 49ers in that position. Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl, including franchise relocations and renaming: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns and Lions had won NFL Championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions' >More...</a><hr><h2> Super Bowl</h2><p>The <b>Super Bowl</b> is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), the highest level of professional American football in the United States, culminating a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. The Super Bowl uses Roman numerals to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The most recent game, Super Bowl XLVIII, was played on February 2, 2014, following the 2013 season.</p>
<p>The game was created as part of a merger agreement between the NFL and its then-rival league, the American Football League (AFL). It was agreed that the two leagues' champion teams would play in the <b>AFLâ€“NFL World Championship Game</b> until the merger was to officially begin in 1970. After the merger, each league was redesignated as a "conference", and the game was then played between the conference champions. Currently, the National Football Conference (NFC) leads the league with 25 wins to 22 wins for the American Football Conference (AFC). The Pittsburgh Steelers hold the record for Super Bowl victories with six.</p>
<p>The day on which the Super Bowl is played, now considered by some a <i>de facto</i> American national holiday, is called "Super Bowl Sunday". It is the second-largest day for U.S. food consumption, after Thanksgiving Day. In addition, the Super Bowl has frequently been the most watched American television broadcast of the year; the four most-watched broadcasts in U.S. television history are Super Bowls. In 2011, Super Bowl XLV became the most-watched American television program in history with an average audience of 111 million viewers, surpassing the previous year's Super Bowl, which itself had taken over the number-one spot held for 28 years by the final episode of <i>M*A*S*H</i>. The Super Bowl is also among the most-watched sporting events in the world, almost all audiences being North American, and is second to soccer's UEFA Champions League final as the most watched <i>annual</i> sporting event worldwide.</p>
<p>The NFL restricts the use of its "Super Bowl" trademark; it is frequently called the <b>Big Game</b> or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations. Because of the high viewership, commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast is the most expensive of the year, leading to companies regularly developing their most expensive advertisements for this broadcast. As a result, watching and discussing the broadcast's commercials has become a significant aspect of the event. In addition, popular singers and musicians including Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, The Rolling Stones, The Who, and Whitney Houston have performed during the event's pre-game and halftime ceremonies.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl' >More...</a><hr><h2> Seattle Seahawks</h2><p>The <b>Seattle Seahawks</b> are a professional American football franchise in the National Football League (NFL) based in Seattle, Washington. They are members of the West Division of the National Football Conference (NFC). The Seahawks joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team along with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Seahawks are owned by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, and are currently coached by Pete Carroll. Since 2002 the Seahawks have played their home games at CenturyLink Field near downtown Seattle after previously playing home games in the Kingdome (1976â€“1999) and Husky Stadium (1994, 2000-2001).</p>
<p>The Seahawks are the only NFL franchise located in the Pacific Northwest region of North America and thus attract support from a wide geographical area, including Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Alaska, as well as Canadian fans in British Columbia and Alberta. Seahawks fans are known collectively as the "12th Man" and have set numerous international stadium sound records.</p>
<p>The Seahawks have won eight division titles and appeared in Super Bowl XL after the 2005 season, and won the NFL Championship at Super Bowl XLVIII. Seattle is the only team to have played in both the AFC and NFC Championship Games, having relocated from the AFC to the NFC during league realignment prior to the 2002 season.</p>
<p>Over the years the Seahawks have had some notable stars on the team, such as Steve Largent, Jim Zorn, Dave Krieg, Kenny Easley, Curt Warner, Joe Nash, Brian Blades, Cortez Kennedy, Joey Galloway, Warren Moon, Walter Jones, Shaun Alexander, Matt Hasselbeck, and Marshawn Lynch. Largent, Kennedy, and Moon have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, with Jones' 2014 induction having been announced. Easley, Jones, Kennedy, Krieg, Largent, Warner, and Zorn have been inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor, along with cornerback Dave Brown and defensive end Jacob Green.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks' >More...</a><hr><h2> Red Hot Chili Peppers</h2><p><b>Red Hot Chili Peppers</b> (also sometimes shortened to the <b>"Chili Peppers"</b> or abbreviated as <b>"RHCP"</b>) are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael "Flea" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and have become one of the best-selling bands of all time, selling over 80 million records worldwide. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.</p>
<p>Because of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, <i>The Red Hot Chili Peppers</i> (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on the second and third albums by the band, <i>Freaky Styley</i> (1985) and <i>The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</i> (1987); he died of a heroin overdose in 1988. As a result of the death of his friend, drummer Irons chose to depart from the group. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio albums starting with 1989's <i>Mother's Milk</i>. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded under producer Rick Rubin the album <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> (1991), which became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the world tour.</p>
<p>After recruiting guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Jesse Tobias though after a few weeks he was replaced by Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, <i>One Hot Minute</i> (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro was fired from the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record <i>Californication</i> (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 15 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by <i>By the Way</i> (2002), and then four years later by the double album <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> (2006), their first number one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band to focus on his solo career. Josh Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, joined as lead guitarist in 2009 and the band spent the next year and a half recording their tenth studio album, <i>I'm with You</i>, which was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries and included a world tour which lasted almost two years. The band followed up that tour with more shows continuing into 2014 which included an appearance as halftime performers at Super Bowl XLVIII. The band plans to start working on their eleventh studio album in 2014.</p>
