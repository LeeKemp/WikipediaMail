		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 27 November 2013 </h1><h2> Ian Watkins (Lostprophets)</h2><p><b>Ian David Karslake Watkins</b> (born 30 July 1977) is a Welsh former rock musician. He was a founding member and the lead vocalist and lyricist of the Welsh alternative rock band Lostprophets.</p>
<p>The group disbanded in 2013 after Watkins was charged with sexual offences in late 2012. In November 2013, Watkins pleaded guilty to a number of charges including the attempted rape and sexual assault of a child under 13.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Watkins_(Lostprophets)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Lostprophets</h2><p><b>Lostprophets</b> /lɒstˈprɒfɪts/ were a Welsh rock band from Pontypridd, formed in 1997. Founded by vocalist Ian Watkins, bassist (later guitarist) Mike Lewis, drummer Mike Chiplin and guitarist Lee Gaze, they were originally a side-project to hardcore punk band Public Disturbance. Lostprophets released five studio albums, with their final release <i>Weapons</i> being released on 2 April 2012. They were also part of the Cardiff music scene.</p>
<p>In late 2012, Watkins was charged with multiple sexual offences against children. The band cancelled all future tour dates and their future remained uncertain until the other members announced the breakup of Lostprophets in October 2013.</p>
<p>The band achieved two top ten hits on the UK Singles Chart ("Last Train Home" and "Rooftops"), one number one single on the Alternative Songs chart ("Last Train Home"), several Kerang! Awards and nominations, and have sold around 3.5 million albums worldwide.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lostprophets' >More...</a><hr><h2> Ted Kaczynski</h2><p><b>Theodore John</b> "<b>Ted</b>" <b>Kaczynski</b> (/kəˈzɪnski/ <i>ka-<b>ZIN</b>-skee</i>, or <i>ka-<b>CHIN</b>-skee</i>; Polish: <i>Kaczyński</i>, pronounced [kaˈt͡ʂɨȷ̃skʲi]; born May 22, 1942), also known as the "<b>Unabomber,</b>" is an American mathematician and serial murderer. He is known for his wide-ranging social critiques, which embraced opposition to industrialism, modern technology and political leftists. Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski engaged in a nationwide bombing campaign against people involved with modern technology, planting or mailing numerous home-made bombs, ultimately killing a total of three people and injuring 23 others.</p>
<p>Kaczynski was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. While growing up in Chicago he was a child prodigy, excelling academically from an early age. Kaczynski was accepted into Harvard University at the age of 16, where he earned an undergraduate degree. He subsequently earned a PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan. He became an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1967 at age 25. He resigned two years later.</p>
<p>In 1971, he moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water, in Lincoln, Montana, where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient. From 1978 to 1995, Kaczynski sent 16 bombs to targets including universities and airlines, killing three people and injuring 23. Kaczynski sent a letter to <i>The New York Times</i> on April 24, 1995 and promised "to desist from terrorism" if the <i>Times</i> or the <i>Washington Post</i> published his manifesto, <i>Industrial Society and Its Future</i> (also called the "Unabomber Manifesto"), in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom necessitated by modern technologies requiring large-scale organization.</p>
<p>The Unabomber was the target of one of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's costliest investigations. Before Kaczynski's identity was known, the FBI used the title "UNABOM" (UNiversity &amp; Airline BOMber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media calling him the Unabomber. The FBI (as well as Attorney General Janet Reno) pushed for the publication of Kaczynski's "Manifesto," which led to his sister-in-law, and then his brother, recognizing Kaczynski's style of writing and beliefs from the manifesto, and tipping off the FBI. Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court appointed lawyers because they wanted to plead insanity in order to avoid the death penalty, as Kaczynski did not believe he was insane. When it became clear that his pending trial would entail national television exposure for Kaczynski, the court entered a plea agreement, under which he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole. He has been designated a "domestic terrorist" by the FBI. Some anarcho-primitivist authors, such as John Zerzan and John Moore, have come to his defense, while holding some reservations about his actions and ideas.</p>

She is the chief foreign affairs correspondent for CBS News, and a correspondent for CBS's <i>60 Minutes</i>.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Logan' >More...</a><hr><h2> Hanukkah</h2><p><b>Hanukkah</b> (/ˈhɑːnəkə/ <i><b>HAH</b>-nə-kə</i>; Hebrew: חֲנֻכָּה, Tiberian: Ḥănukkāh, usually spelled חנוכה, pronounced /χanuˈka/ in Modern Hebrew; a transliteration also romanized as <b>Chanukah</b>, <b>Chanukkah</b> or <b>[Chanuˈkah]</b>), also known as the <b>Festival of Lights</b> and <b>Feast of Dedication</b>, is an eight-day Jewish holiday commemorating the rededication of the Holy Temple (the Second Temple) in Jerusalem at the time of the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire of the 2nd century BCE. Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days, starting on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which may occur at any time from late November to late December in the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>The festival is observed by the kindling of the lights of a unique candelabrum, the nine-branched <i>Menorah</i> or <i>Hanukiah</i>, one additional light on each night of the holiday, progressing to eight on the final night. The typical Menorah consists of eight branches with an additional raised branch. The extra light is called a <i>shamash</i> (Hebrew: שמש‎, "attendant") and is given a distinct location, usually above or below the rest. The purpose of the <i>shamash</i> is to have a light available for practical use, as using the Hanukkah lights themselves for purposes other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah is forbidden.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah' >More...</a><hr><h2> Black Friday (shopping)</h2><p><b>Black Friday</b> is the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States, often regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. In recent years, most major retailers have opened extremely early and offered promotional sales to kick off the holiday shopping season, similar to Boxing Day sales in many Commonwealth Nations. Black Friday is not a federal holiday, but California and some other states observe "The Day After Thanksgiving" as a holiday for state government employees, sometimes in lieu of another federal holiday such as Columbus Day. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the day after off, followed by a weekend, thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers. It has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year since 2005, although news reports, which at that time were inaccurate, have described it as the busiest shopping day of the year for a much longer period of time.</p>
<p>The day's name originated in Philadelphia, where it originally was used to describe the heavy and disruptive pedestrian and vehicle traffic which would occur on the day after Thanksgiving. Use of the term started before 1961 and began to see broader use outside Philadelphia around 1975. Later an alternative explanation was made: that retailers traditionally operated at a financial loss from January through November, and "Black Friday" indicates the point at which retailers begin to turn a profit, or "in the black". For large retail chains like Walmart, their net income is positive starting from January 1, and Black Friday can boost their year to date net profit from $14 billion to $19 billion.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p>For many years, it was common for retailers to open at 6:00 a.m., but in the late 2000s many had crept to 5:00 or even 4:00. This was taken to a new extreme in 2011, when several retailers (including Target, Kohl's, Macy's, Best Buy, and Bealls) opened at midnight for the first time. In 2012, Walmart and several other retailers announced that they would open most of their stores at 8:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day (except in states where opening on Thanksgiving is prohibited due to blue laws, such as Massachusetts where they still opened around midnight), prompting calls for a walkout among some workers. Black Friday shopping is known for attracting aggressive crowds, with annual reports of assaults, shootings, and throngs of people trampling on other shoppers in an attempt to get the best deal on a product before supplies run out.</p>
