    <p><i><b>How I Met Your Mother</b></i> (often abbreviated to <i><b>HIMYM</b></i>) is an American sitcom that originally ran on CBS from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014. The series follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in the year 2030, recounts to his son and daughter the events that led him to meeting their mother.</p>
    <p>The show was created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays, who also served as the show's executive producers and were frequent writers. The series was loosely inspired by their friendship when they both lived in New York City. Among the 208 episodes, there were only four directors: Pamela Fryman (196 episodes), Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).</p>
    <p>Known for its unique structure and eccentric humor, <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> received positive reviews throughout its run and gained a cult following over the years. The show was nominated for 28 Emmy Awards, winning nine. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor.</p>

    <p>The ninth and final season of <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>, an American sitcom created by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, premiered on CBS on September 23, 2013, with two episodes, and concluded on March 31, 2014. The show was renewed for the final season on December 21, 2012, after cast member Jason Segel changed his decision to leave the show after Season 8. Cristin Milioti, who was revealed as "The Mother" in the Season 8 finale, was promoted to a series regular, the first time <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> added a new regular cast member. Season 9 consists of 24 episodes, each running approximately 22 minutes in length.</p>
    <p>Taking place immediately after where the previous season left off, Season 9 covers the events of a single weekend that lead up to Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) and Robin's (Cobie Smulders) wedding. During the course of the weekend, "The Mother" (Milioti) will separately be introduced to Robin, Barney, Lily (Alyson Hannigan), and Marshall (Jason Segel), before finally meeting Ted (Josh Radnor). The season will also feature frequent flashbacks and flashforwards in order to fully integrate The Mother's character with the rest of the cast. Thomas said in an interview that Season 9 is like "the Wild West – anything can happen".</p>
    <p>In February 2013, Bays and Thomas teased that Season 9 is "going to be a new way to tell the story". The initial reaction to the new storytelling structure of Season 9 was mixed. Ethan Anderton from <i>Screen Rant</i> was concerned about how "24 episodes of television are going to be crafted from just three days of time", and Alan Sepinwall of <i>HitFix</i> was exasperated that after eight seasons, "They are really going to stretch Robin and Barney's wedding weekend out over the entire final season," though he expressed more optimism after the San Diego Comic-Con panel for the final season. Gareth Mitchell at "House of Geekery" also responded negatively, stating that they are "struggling to come up with stories that last out the 22 minutes".</p>

    <p><b>Java</b> (Indonesian: <i><b>Jawa</b></i>; Javanese: ꦗꦮ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population roughly equal to Russia as of 2014, (excluding the 3.7 million on the island of Madura which is administered as part of the province of East Java), Java is the world's most populous island, and one of the most densely populated places in the world. Java is the home of 57 percent of the Indonesian population. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 40s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.</p>
    <p>Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions, Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in Indonesia. A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east-west spine along the island. It has three main languages, with Javanese being the dominant language; it is the native language of about 60 million people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java. Most of its residents are bilingual, with Indonesian as their first or second languages. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java has a diverse mixture of religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.</p>
    <p>Java is divided into four provinces, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Banten, and also two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.</p>

  title: Climatic Research Unit email controversy
  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>Climatic Research Unit email controversy</b> (also known as <b>"Climategate"</b>) began in November 2009 with the hacking of a server at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) by an external attacker. Several weeks before the Copenhagen Summit on climate change, an unknown individual or group breached CRU's server and copied thousands of emails and computer files to various locations on the Internet.</p>
    <p>The story was first broken by climate change critics on their blogs, with columnist James Delingpole popularising the term "Climategate" to describe the controversy. Climate change critics and others denying the significance of human caused climate change argued that the emails showed that global warming was a scientific conspiracy, in which they alleged that scientists manipulated climate data and attempted to suppress critics. The accusations were rejected by the CRU, who said that the emails had been taken out of context and merely reflected an honest exchange of ideas.</p>
    <p>The mainstream media picked up the story as negotiations over climate change mitigation began in Copenhagen on 7 December. Because of the timing, scientists, policy makers, and public relations experts said that the release of emails was a smear campaign intended to undermine the climate conference. In response to the controversy, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released statements supporting the scientific consensus that the Earth's mean surface temperature had been rising for decades, with the AAAS concluding "based on multiple lines of scientific evidence that global climate change caused by human activities is now underway...it is a growing threat to society."</p>
    <p>Eight committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. However, the reports called on the scientists to avoid any such allegations in the future by taking steps to regain public confidence in their work, for example by opening up access to their supporting data, processing methods and software, and by promptly honouring freedom of information requests. The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged throughout the investigations.</p>

    <p><b>April Fools' Day</b> (sometimes called <b>April Fool's Day</b> or <b>All Fools' Day</b>) is an informal holiday celebrated every year on April 1. Popular since medieval times, the day is not a national holiday in any country, but it is widely recognized throughout European cultures and celebrated as a day when people play practical jokes and hoaxes on each other, both the jokes and their victims being known as "April fools". Hoax stories are often presented by the press and other media on this day.</p>

  title: Automobile
  extract: |-
    <p>An <b>automobile</b>, <b>autocar</b>, <b>motor car</b> or <b>car</b> is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transporting passengers, which also carries its own engine or motor. Most definitions of the term specify that automobiles are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods.</p>
    <p>The year 1886 is regarded the year of birth of the modern automobile - with the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, by German inventor Karl Benz. Motorized wagons soon replaced animal-drafted carriages, especially after automobiles became affordable for many people when the Ford Model T was introduced in 1908.</p>
    <p>The term <i>motorcar</i> has formerly also been used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage. These locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems.</p>
    <p>It was estimated in 2010 that the number of automobiles had risen to over 1 billion vehicles, up from the 500 million of 1986. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other NICs.</p>

    <p><i>How I Met Your Mother</i> is a North American sitcom written and created by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas. It was first aired on September 19, 2005 on CBS with a thirty-minute pilot episode, and finished its planned nine-year run in 2014 after 208 episodes. Set in present-day Manhattan, the series follows the social and romantic lives of five friends, Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) and his friends Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), and Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), as Ted seeks out his future wife (Cristin Milioti). The show tells this story through the framing device of "future" Ted (Bob Saget) as an unreliable narrator who is recounting to his son and daughter the events that led him to their mother. In Seasons 1–8, episodes are typically set to a similar timeline as its real-world airdate, with the season finale generally taking place in the spring and the next season premiere in the fall, usually with a quick recap of the events that took place during the summer. The final season (season 9) deviates from this format by taking place immediately after the end of the previous season and encompassing only the weekend of Barney's and Robin's wedding.</p>
    <p><i>How I Met Your Mother</i> premiered to nearly 11 million viewers and has since maintained a generally steady viewership. The first seven seasons are available on DVD in Region 1, 2, and 4, while the season eight DVD will be released in Region 1 and 2 in October 2013. In addition, the first eight seasons are available for streaming on Netflix and Amazon Instant Video, and may be purchased from the US iTunes store.</p>

  extract: |-
    <p>Chess has been played in Armenia since the Early Middle Ages; however, it was institutionalized during the early Soviet period. Highly popular in Armenia today, chess gained widespread recognition during the 1960s, when Soviet Armenian grandmaster Tigran Petrosian became the World Chess Champion. A country of about three million people, Armenia is considered one of the strongest chess nations today. Among countries, Armenia has one of the most chess grandmasters per capita.</p>
    <p>Since the country's independence, the Armenian men's chess team has won the European Team Championship (1999), the World Team Championship (2011) and the Chess Olympiad (2006, 2008, 2012). The women's team had its crowning victory at the 2003 European Championship. As of December 2013, Armenia ranks sixth in the world by the average rating of its top players. Levon Aronian, Armenia's best chess player, is currently world No. 2 in the FIDE rankings. Aronian was a World Champion candidate in 2007, 2012 and 2013.</p>
    <p>Since the 2011–12 school year, chess lessons have been made part of the curriculum in every public school in Armenia, making it the first country in the world to make chess mandatory in schools.</p>

  title: High-temperature superconductivity
  extract: |-
    <p><b>High-temperature superconductors</b> (abbreviated <b>high-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub></b> or <b>HTS</b>) are materials that behave as superconductors at unusually high temperatures. The first high-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> superconductor was discovered in 1986 by IBM researchers Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller, who were awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Physics "for their important break-through in the discovery of superconductivity in ceramic materials".</p>
    <p>For an explanation about <b>T<sub>c</sub></b> (the critical temperature for supercondictivity), see Superconductivity#Superconducting phase transition and the second bullet item of BCS theory#Successes of the BCS theory.</p>
    <p>Whereas "ordinary" or metallic superconductors usually have transition temperatures (temperatures below which they superconduct) below 30 K (−243.2 °C), HTS have been observed with transition temperatures as high as 138 K (−135 °C). Until 2008, only certain compounds of copper and oxygen (so-called "cuprates") were believed to have HTS properties, and the term high-temperature superconductor was used interchangeably with cuprate superconductor for compounds such as bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) and yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO). However, several iron-based compounds (the iron pnictides) are now known to be superconducting at high temperatures.</p>

    <p><i><b>X-Men</b></i> is a 2000 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is the first installment in the <i>X-Men</i> film series. The film directed by Bryan Singer, written by David Hayter, and features an ensemble cast that includes Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, Bruce Davison, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn, Ray Park and Tyler Mane. It depicts a world in which a small proportion of people are mutants, whose possession of superhuman powers makes them distrusted by normal humans. The film focuses on the mutants Wolverine and Rogue as they are brought into a conflict between two groups that have radically different approaches to bringing about the acceptance of mutantkind: Professor Xavier's X-Men, and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto.</p>
    <p>Development for <i>X-Men</i> began as far back as 1989 with James Cameron and Carolco Pictures. The film rights went to 20th Century Fox in 1994. Scripts and film treatments were commissioned from Andrew Kevin Walker, John Logan, Joss Whedon and Michael Chabon. Singer signed to direct in 1996, with further rewrites by Ed Solomon, Singer, Tom DeSanto, Christopher McQuarrie and David Hayter. Start dates kept getting pushed back, while Fox decided to move <i>X-Men'</i>s release date from December to July 2000. Filming took place from September 22, 1999 to March 3, 2000, primarily in Toronto. <i>X-Men</i> was released to positive reviews and was a financial success, starting the <i>X-Men</i> film franchise and spawning a reemergence of superhero films.</p>
