  title: Mary Anning
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Mary Anning</b> (21 May 1799 – 9 March 1847) was a British fossil collector, dealer, and palaeontologist who became known around the world for important findings she made in the Jurassic marine fossil beds at Lyme Regis in Dorset, a county in Southwest England on the coast of the English Channel, where she lived. Her work contributed to fundamental changes that occurred during her lifetime in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the Earth.</p>
    <p>Mary Anning searched for fossils in the area's Blue Lias cliffs, particularly during the winter months when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. It was dangerous work, and she nearly lost her life in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first ichthyosaur skeleton correctly identified, which she and her brother Joseph found when she was just twelve years old; the first two plesiosaur skeletons found; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations played a key role in the discovery that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods. When geologist Henry De la Beche painted <i>Duria Antiquior</i>, the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.</p>
    <p>Anning's gender and social class prevented her from fully participating in the scientific community of 19th-century Britain, dominated as it was by wealthy Anglican gentlemen. She struggled financially for much of her life. Her family was poor, and as religious dissenters, were subject to legal discrimination. Her father, a cabinetmaker, died when she was eleven.</p>
    <p>She became well known in geological circles in Britain, Europe, and America, and was consulted on issues of anatomy as well as about collecting fossils. Nonetheless, as a woman, she was not eligible to join the Geological Society of London and she did not always receive full credit for her scientific contributions. Indeed, she wrote in a letter: "The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone." The only scientific writing of hers published in her lifetime appeared in the <i>Magazine of Natural History</i> in 1839, an extract from a letter that Anning had written to the magazine's editor questioning one of its claims.</p>
    <p>After her death in 1847, her unusual life story attracted increasing interest. Charles Dickens wrote of her in 1865 that "[t]he carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it." In 2010, one hundred and sixty-three years after her death, the Royal Society included Anning in a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science.</p>

  title: Copyright Alert System
  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>Copyright Alert System</b> (CAS) is a private system for alerting, educating, and punishing Internet subscribers of the Internet service providers AT&amp;T, Cablevision, Time Warner, Verizon and Comcast based on accusations of BitTorrent and peer-to-peer file sharing use to distribute copyrighted material from a list of specific entertainment corporations and their CAS registered content. It is limited to customers of those Internet vendors in the United States. The press has branded the CAS as a "<b>six strikes</b>" program.</p>
    <p>The CAS is intended to be a graduated response system wherein participating ISPs send up to six electronic warnings notifying subscribers of alleged copyright infringement, as reported by a monitoring service working on behalf of participating copyright owners. If copyright infringement is reported after a final warning, the ISPs have agreed to implement "mitigation measures", which can include penalties such as bandwidth throttling.</p>
    <p>The CAS framework was established on July 7, 2011 by the Center for Copyright Information (CCI), after 3 years in the making. After multiple delays, ISPs began implementing it in late February 2013.</p>

  title: Checker shadow illusion
  extract: |-
    <p>The <b>checker shadow illusion</b> is an optical illusion published by Edward H. Adelson, Professor of Vision Science at MIT in 1995. The image depicts a checkerboard with light and dark squares. The optical illusion is that the area of the image labeled A appears to be a darker color than the area of the image labeled B. However, they are actually exactly the same color.</p>
    <p>This can be proven using the following methods:</p>
    <ul><li>Opening the illusion in an image editing program and using the eyedropper tool to verify that the colors are the same</li>
    <li>Isolating the squares. Without the surrounding context, the effect of the illusion is dispelled. This can be done by using the selection tool in some image editing programs.</li>
    <li>Using a photometer</li>
    <li>Connecting the squares with a rectangle of the same color, as seen below in the middle figure.</li>

  title: Genghis Khan
  extract: |-
    <p><b>Genghis Khan</b> (/ˈɡɛŋɡɪs ˈkɑːn/ or /ˈdʒɛŋɡɪs ˈkɑːn/, <small>Mongol: </small>[tʃiŋɡɪs xaːŋ]<small class="nowrap"> ( )</small>; Chingis/Chinghis Khan; 1162? – August 1227), born <b>Temujin</b>, was the founder and Great Khan (emperor) of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous empire in history after his demise.</p>
    <p>He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of northeast Asia. After founding the Mongol Empire and being proclaimed "Genghis Khan," he started the Mongol invasions that resulted in the conquest of most of Eurasia. These included raids or invasions of the Kara-Khitan Khanate, Caucasus, Khwarezmid Empire, Western Xia and Jin dynasties. These campaigns were often accompanied by wholesale massacres of the civilian populations – especially in the Khwarezmian controlled lands. By the end of his life, the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China.</p>
    <p>Before Genghis Khan died, he assigned Ögedei Khan as his successor and split his empire into khanates among his sons and grandsons. He died in 1227 after defeating the Western Xia. He was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia at an unknown location. His descendants extended the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia by conquering or creating vassal states out of all of modern-day China, Korea, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and substantial portions of modern Eastern Europe, Russia, and the Middle East. Many of these invasions repeated the earlier large-scale slaughters of local populations. As a result Genghis Khan and his empire have a fearsome reputation in local histories.</p>
    <p>Beyond his military accomplishments, Genghis Khan also advanced the Mongol Empire in other ways. He decreed the adoption of the Uyghur script as the Mongol Empire's writing system. He also practiced meritocracy and encouraged religious tolerance in the Mongol Empire while unifying the nomadic tribes of northeast Asia. Present-day Mongolians regard him as the founding father of Mongolia.</p>
    <p>Vilified throughout most of history for the brutality of his campaigns, Genghis Khan is also credited with bringing the Silk Road under one cohesive political environment. This increased communication and trade from Northeast Asia to Muslim Southwest Asia and Christian Europe, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas.</p>

  title: C-4 (explosive)
  extract: |-
    <p><b>C-4</b> or <b>Composition C-4</b> is a common variety of the plastic explosive known as Composition C.</p>
    <p>C4 is composed of explosives, plastic binder, plasticizer and usually a marker or odorizing taggant chemical such as 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMDNB) to help detect the explosive and identify its source.</p>
    <p>The explosive in C4 is RDX (cyclonite or cyclotrimethylene trinitramine), which makes up around 91% of C4 by mass. The plasticizer is diethylhexyl (5.3%) or dioctyl sebacate and the binder is usually polyisobutylene (2.1%). Another plasticizer used is dioctyl adipate (DOA). A small amount of SAE 10 non-detergent motor oil (1.6%) is also added. C4 is manufactured by combining the noted ingredients with binder dissolved in a solvent. The solvent is then evaporated and the mixture dried and filtered. The final material is an off-white solid with a texture similar to modelling clay.</p>
