		<h1>Popular Pages - Monday 03 March 2014 </h1><h2> Equilibrium constant</h2><p>The equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction is the value of the reaction quotient when the reaction has reached equilibrium. At any given temperature, the equilibrium constant has a value which is independent of the initial and actual concentrations of the reactant and product species. For a given set of initial concentrations, the equilibrium constant can be used to determine the composition of a system at equilibrium.</p>
<p>For a general chemical equilibrium</p>
<dl><dd></dd>
</dl><p>the thermodynamic equilibrium constant can be defined such that, at equilibrium,</p>
<dl><dd></dd>
</dl><p>where curly brackets denote the thermodynamic activities of the chemical species. The right-hand side of this equation corresponds to the reaction quotient Q for arbitrary values of the activities, and becomes the equilibrium constant as shown when the reaction is at equilibrium. The logarithm of this expression appears in the formula for the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. If deviations from ideal behaviour are neglected, the activities of solutes may be replaced by concentrations, [<i>A</i>], and a concentration quotient, <i>K</i><sub>c</sub>.</p>
<dl><dd></dd>
</dl><p><i>K</i><sub>c</sub> is defined which is equal to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant divided by a quotient of activity coefficients. For ideal behaviour this quotient has a value of 1, and <i>K</i><sub>c</sub> = <i>K</i><sup></sup>. (<i>K</i><sub>c</sub> appears here to have units of concentration raised to some power while <i>K</i><sup></sup> is dimensionless; however as discussed below under Definitions, the concentration factors in <i>K</i><sub>c</sub> are properly divided by a standard concentration so that <i>K</i><sub>c</sub> is dimensionless also.)</p>
<p>Again assuming ideal behavior, the activity of a solvent may be replaced by its mole fraction, or approximately by 1 in dilute solution. The activity of a pure liquid or solid phase is exactly 1. The activity of a species in an ideal gas phase may be replaced by its partial pressure.</p>
<p>A knowledge of equilibrium constants is essential for the understanding of many chemical systems, as well as biochemical processes such as oxygen transport by hemoglobin in blood and acid-base homeostasis in the human body.</p>
<p>Stability constants, formation constants, binding constants, association constants and dissociation constants are all types of <b>equilibrium constant</b>. See also Determination of equilibrium constants for experimental and computational methods.</p>

Principal photography took place in New Orleans, Louisiana, from June 27 to August 13, 2012, on a production budget of $20 million. The locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: Felicity, Magnolia, Bocage, and Destrehan. Of the four, Magnolia is nearest to the actual plantation where Northup was held.</p>
<p><i>12 Years a Slave</i> received critical acclaim following its release in 2013, and was named the best film of the year by several media outlets.
