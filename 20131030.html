		<h1>Popular Pages - Wednesday 30 October 2013 </h1><h2> Midge (Barbie)</h2><p><b>Midge Hadley</b> is a fictional doll character in the Barbie line of toys by Mattel that was first released in 1963. Midge was created, along with Skipper, to counteract criticism that claimed Barbie was a sex symbol. She was marketed as Barbie's best friend. No Midge dolls were sold for the rest of the vintage years after the 1960s.</p>
<p>Midge was re-introduced in 1988 as part of the play line, though two vintage reproduction dolls were made specifically for collectors in 1993 and 1998. The dolls sold in this time period usually had red hair, often with freckles, and her eye color was usually blue. Also in the period, Wedding Day Midge was sold, with the groom being Alan Sherwood, who had been marketed as Midge's boyfriend in the vintage years. Midge and Alan had three children introduced named Ryan, Nikki, and Cassandra. They also had twins who were never introduced. This was known as the Happy Family line, and in the set, Midge was sold "pregnant" with Nikki as a newborn baby. The Happy Family product became the subject of controversy when some parents disliked the "pregnant" Midge toy because they believed that Midge was too young to have children.</p>
<p>In 2013 Mattel decided to revamp Midge's history, reintroducing her as a best friend of Barbie's, but unmarried, without children, and with no connection to Alan.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midge_(Barbie)' >More...</a><hr><h2> Marmaray</h2><p><b>Marmaray</b> (<small>pronounced </small>[ˈmaɾmaˌɾaj]<small class="nowrap"> ( listen)</small>) is a rail transport project in the Turkish city of Istanbul. It comprises an undersea rail tunnel under the Bosphorus strait, and the modernization of existing suburban railway lines along the Sea of Marmara from Halkalı on the European side to Gebze on the Asian side. The procurement of new rolling stock for suburban passenger traffic is also part of the project. Construction started in 2004, with an initial target opening date of April 2009. After multiple delays due to historical finds, the first phase of the project opened on October 29, 2013.</p>
<p>The name <i>Marmaray</i> comes from combining the name of the Sea of Marmara, which lies just south of the project site, with <i>ray</i>, the Turkish word for <i>rail</i>.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmaray' >More...</a><hr><h2> Bitcoin</h2><p><b>Bitcoin</b> (sign: ; code: <b>BTC</b> or <b>XBT</b>) is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without the intermediation of any central authority. The concept was introduced in a 2008 paper by a pseudonymous developer known only as "Satoshi Nakamoto".</p>
<p>Bitcoin is called a cryptocurrency since it is decentralized and uses cryptography to prevent double-spending, a significant challenge inherent to digital currencies. Once validated, every individual transaction is permanently recorded in a public ledger known as the blockchain. The calculations required to authenticate Bitcoin transactions are completed using a network of private computers often specially tailored to this task. As of May 2013, the Bitcoin network processing power "exceeds the combined processing strength of the top 500 most powerful supercomputers". The operators of these computers, known as "miners", are rewarded with transaction fees and newly minted bitcoins. However, new bitcoins are created at an ever-decreasing rate. Once 21 million bitcoins are distributed, issuance will cease. As of August 2013, approximately 11.5 million bitcoins were in circulation.</p>
<p>In 2012, <i>The Economist</i> reasoned that Bitcoin has been popular due to "its role in dodgy online markets," and in 2013 the FBI shut down one such service, Silk Road, which specialized in illegal drugs (whereupon the FBI came into the control of approximately 1.5% of all Bitcoins in circulation). However, Bitcoins are increasingly used as payment for legitimate products and services. Notable vendors include Wordpress, OkCupid, Reddit, and Chinese Internet giant Baidu.</p>
<p>Speculators have been attracted to Bitcoin, fueling volatility and price swings. As of July 2013, there is relatively small use of bitcoins in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively large use by speculators.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin' >More...</a><hr><h2> Vaginal lubrication</h2><p><b>Vaginal lubrication</b> is a lubricating fluid that is naturally produced in a woman's vagina. Vaginal lubrication or moistness is always present, but production increases significantly during sexual arousal in anticipation of sexual intercourse. <b>Vaginal dryness</b> is the condition in which this lubrication is insufficient, and sometimes artificial lubricants are used to augment it. Without sufficient lubrication, sexual intercourse can be painful to the woman. The vagina has no glands, and therefore must rely on other methods of lubrication. Plasma seepage from vaginal walls due to vascular engorgement is considered to be the chief lubrication source, and the Bartholin's glands, located slightly below and to the left and right of the introitus (opening of the vagina), also secrete mucus to augment vaginal-wall secretions.</p>

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_lubrication' >More...</a><hr><h2> Eiffel Tower</h2><p>The <b>Eiffel Tower</b> (French: <b>La Tour Eiffel</b>, [tuʁ ɛfɛl]) is an iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris. It was named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Erected in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, it has become both a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The tower is the tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world; 7.1 million people ascended it in 2011. The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010.</p>
<p>The tower stands 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930. Because of the addition of the antenna atop the Eiffel Tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 17 feet (5.2 m). Not including broadcast antennas, it is the second-tallest structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct.</p>
<p>The tower has three levels for visitors. The third level observatory's upper platform is at 279.11 m (915.7 ft) the highest accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend, by stairs or lift (elevator), to the first and second levels. The walk from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the walk from the first to the second level. Although there are stairs to the third and highest level, these are usually closed to the public and it is usually accessible only by lift. The first and second levels have restaurants.</p>
<p>The tower has become the most prominent symbol of both Paris and France, often in the establishing shot of films set in the city.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower' >More...</a><hr><h2> Poison dart frog</h2><p><b>Poison dart frog</b> (also <b>dart-poison frog</b>, <b>poison frog</b> or formerly <b>poison arrow frog</b>) is the common name of a group of frogs in the family <b>Dendrobatidae</b> which are native to Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. Although all wild dendrobatids are at least somewhat toxic, levels of toxicity vary considerably from one species to the next and from one population to another. Many species are threatened. These amphibians are often called "dart frogs" due to the Amerindians' indigenous use of their toxic secretions to poison the tips of blowdarts. However, of over 175 species, only four have been documented as being used for this purpose (curare plants are more commonly used), all of which come from the <i>Phyllobates</i> genus, which is characterized by the relatively large size and high levels of toxicity of its members.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_dart_frog' >More...</a><hr><h2> List of tallest people</h2><p>This is a <b>list of the tallest people</b>, living and dead, from 1835 to the present.

The film was produced with a budget of HK$130 million (US$16,8 million) and filmed between December 2005 and January 2006. <i>Rob-B-Hood</i> is the first film in over 30 years in which Jackie Chan plays an anti-hero.</p>
<p><i>Rob-B-Hood</i> tells the story of a kidnapping gone wrong in Hong Kong; a gang of burglars consisting of Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord kidnap a baby from a wealthy family on behalf of triads. With the Landlord arrested, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby for a short time, developing strong bonds with him. Reluctant to hand the baby over, the two are forced to protect him from the triads who hired them in the first place.</p>
<p><i>Rob-B-Hood</i> was released in Hong Kong, China and Southeast Asia on 29 September 2006 based in Hong Kong to generally positive reviews. The film topped the Chinese box office in October 2006 and despite not being given a release in most European and North American countries, it grossed over US$20 million worldwide.<br></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob-B-Hood' >More...</a><hr><h2> Col de Jambaz  </h2><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_Jambaz__' >More...</a><hr><h2> Col de Jambaz</h2><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_Jambaz' >More...</a><hr><h2> Days of Future Past</h2><p>"<b>Days of Future Past</b>" is a popular storyline in the Marvel Comics comic book <i>The Uncanny X-Men</i> issues #141 and #142, published in 1980.
