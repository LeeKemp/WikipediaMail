<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_a_Down' >More...</a><hr><h2> Acetate</h2><p><b>Acetate</b> /ˈæsɪteɪt/ is a negative ion, or anion, typically found in aqueous solution. It is often written with the chemical formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>. The neutral molecules formed by the combination of the acetate ion and a positive ion (or cation) are also commonly called "acetates". The simplest of these is hydrogen acetate, or acetic acid, with corresponding salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, or CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>.</p>
<p>Most of the approximately 5 billion kilograms of acetic acid produced annually in industry are used in the production of acetates, which usually take the form of polymers. In nature, acetate is the most common building block for biosynthesis. For example, the fatty acids are produced by connecting the two carbon atoms from acetate to a growing fatty acid.</p>

The term was originally used to refer to feelings of being "carefree", "happy", or "bright and showy". The term's use as a reference to homosexuality may date as early as the late 19th century, but its use gradually increased in the 20th century. In modern English, <i>gay</i> has come to be used as an adjective, and as a noun, referring to the people, especially to males, and the practices and cultures associated with homosexuality.</p>
<p>By the end of the 20th century, the word <i>gay</i> was recommended by major LGBT groups and style guides to describe people attracted to members of the same sex. At about the same time, a new, pejorative use became prevalent in some parts of the world. In the Anglosphere, this connotation, among younger speakers, has a derisive meaning equivalent to <i>rubbish</i> or <i>stupid</i> (as in "That's so gay."). In this use, the word does not mean "homosexual", so it can be used, for example, to refer to an inanimate object or abstract concept of which one disapproves. This usage can also refer to weakness or unmanliness. When used in these ways, the extent to which it still retains connotations of homosexuality has been debated and harshly criticized.</p>

It was largely the work of St. Jerome, who was commissioned by Pope Damasus I in 382 to make a revision of the Vetus Latina (old Latin translations). Its widespread adoption eventually led to their eclipse. By the 13th century this revision had come to be called the <i>versio vulgata</i>, that is, the "commonly used translation". In the 16th century it became the definitive and officially promulgated Latin version of the Bible in the Roman Catholic Church.</p>

<p>He has won two Tony Awards, one in 1983 for his featured role in the play <i>Brighton Beach Memoirs</i> and one in 1995 for his leading role in the musical <i>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</i>. He was also nominated for the Tony Award, Best Actor in a Musical, for <i>The Producers</i> but lost to his co-star Nathan Lane. As of 2013<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup>, Broderick is the youngest winner of the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Broderick' >More...</a><hr><h2> Affluenza</h2><p><b>Affluenza</b>, a portmanteau of <i>affluence</i> and <i>influenza</i>, is a term used by critics of consumerism. The book <i>Affluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic</i> defines it as "a painful, contagious, socially transmitted condition of overload, debt, anxiety and waste resulting from the dogged pursuit of more".</p>
<p>Proponents of the term consider that the prizing of endless increases in material wealth may lead to feelings of worthlessness and dissatisfaction rather than experiences of a 'better life', and that these symptoms may be usefully captured with the metaphor of a disease. They claim some or even many of those who become wealthy will find the economic success leaving them unfulfilled and hungry only for more wealth, finding that they are unable to get pleasure from the things they buy and that increasingly material things may come to dominate their time and thoughts to the detriment of personal relationships and to feelings of happiness.</p>
<p>A potential criticism of the idea of affluenza is that it presents subjective social critique as an objective, inevitable and debilitating illness.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluenza' >More...</a><hr><h2> A few acres of snow</h2><p>"<b>A few acres of snow</b>" (in the original French, "<i>quelques arpents de neige</i>", <small>French pronunciation: ​</small>[kɛlkə.z‿aʁpɑ̃dəˈnɛːʒ], with "<i>vers le Canada</i>") is one of several quotations from Voltaire, the 18th-century writer, which are representative of his sneering evaluation of Canada as lacking economic value and strategic importance to 18th-century France.</p>
<p>In Voltaire's time, Canada was a territory within New France which covered most of modern day southern Quebec. However, "Canada", was also commonly (if incorrectly) used as a generic term to cover <i>all</i> of New France, including the whole of the Louisiana territory, as well as modern day southern Ontario, Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Which meaning of "Canada" Voltaire intended is a matter of some dispute.</p>
<p>The exact phrase "<i>quelques arpents de neige</i>" first appears in 1758 in chapter 23 of Voltaire's book <i>Candide</i>, although the phrase "a few acres of ice" appeared in a letter he wrote in 1757. Voltaire wrote similar sarcastic remarks in other works.</p>
<p></p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_few_acres_of_snow' >More...</a><hr><h2> Abdul Quader Molla</h2><p><b>Abdul Quader Molla</b> (Bengali: আব্দুল কাদের মোল্লা; 14 August 1948 – 12 December 2013) was a Bangladeshi politician and the assistant secretary-general of the political party Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami He was convicted and executed for crimes against humanity during the 1971 liberation war of Bangladesh by International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh and Bangladesh Supreme Court.</p>
<p>He was the former executive editor of <i>The Daily Sangram</i>, and twice unsuccessfully stood for parliament in 1986 and 1996, contesting the seat Faridpur-4 for Jamaat-e-Islami.</p>
<p>He was convicted on five of six counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes at his trial at the Bangladeshi International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), on 5 February 2013. A member of the Al-Badar militia during the liberation war, Mollah was convicted of killing 344 civilians and other crimes. He was sentenced to life in prison. As a direct result of the sentence the 2013 Shahbag protests began with the protesters demanding capital punishment for all those on trial. The protest spread from Dhaka to other parts of the country. Protesters called for those convicted of war crimes to be sentenced to capital punishment, and also to ban Jamaat-e-Islami. Jamaat-e-Islami started a violent counter-protest in the country, demanding the release of its convicted and accused leaders. On 17 September 2013, after an amendment to the ICT law which allowed the government, complainant, or informant to appeal an order of acquittal or order of sentencing, the Bangladesh Supreme Court found Molla guilty of murders and other war crimes and his life sentence was converted to a death sentence. He was scheduled to be executed by hanging on 11 December, but after the execution was suspended and then upheld, he was executed on 12 December, becoming the first person to have been executed for crimes committed during the Bangladesh Liberation War.</p>

Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&amp;B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Knowles' debut album <i>Dangerously in Love</i> (2003), which established her as a viable solo artist worldwide; it sold 11 million copies, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the <i>Billboard</i> number one singles "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy".</p>
<p>Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child in 2005, she released her second solo album, <i>B'Day</i> (2006), which contained hits "Irreplaceable" and "Beautiful Liar". Knowles also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe nominated performance in <i>Dreamgirls</i> (2006), and starring roles in <i>The Pink Panther</i> (2006) and <i>Obsessed</i> (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay-Z and portrayal of Etta James in <i>Cadillac Records</i> (2008) influenced her third album <i>I Am... Sasha Fierce</i> (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". Knowles took a hiatus from music in 2010, took over management of her career and explored 1970s R&amp;B, rock and roll, and African and funk styles. As a result, her subsequent albums, <i>4</i> (2011) and <i>Beyoncé</i> (2013), deviated towards a more experimental sound.</p>
<p>A self-described "modern-day feminist", Knowles' songs are often characterized by themes of love, relationships and monogamy, as well as female sexuality and empowerment. On stage, her dynamic, highly-choreographed performances have led to critics hailing her as one of the best entertainers in contemporary popular music. Throughout a career spanning 15 years, she has won 17 Grammy Awards and sold over 118 million records as a solo artist and 60 million with Destiny's Child, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Recording Industry Association of America recognized Knowles as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s decade. In 2009, <i>Billboard</i> named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade, the Top Female Artist of the 2000s and their Artist of the Millennium. In 2013, she was also included in <i>Time</i> magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p>
