		<h1>Popular Pages - Thursday 06 February 2014 </h1><h2> Marcin Ignaczak</h2><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcin_Ignaczak' >More...</a><hr><h2> Mick Foley</h2><p><b>Michael Francis "Mick" Foley, Sr.</b> (born June 7, 1965) is an American retired professional wrestler, author, comedian, actor, voice actor and former color commentator currently working for WWE as the on-screen general manager for <i>Saturday Morning Slam</i>. He has worked for many wrestling promotions, including WWE, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), as well as numerous promotions in Japan. He is often referred to as "The Hardcore Legend", a nickname he shares with Terry Funk.</p>
<p>Foley has wrestled both under his real name and various personas, including Dude Love, Cactus Jack, and Mankind, also known as the <i>Three Faces of Foley</i>. Foley is a four-time world champion (three WWF Championships, and one TNA World Heavyweight Championship), an 11-time tag team champion (eight WWF Tag Team Titles, two ECW World Tag Team Titles, and one WCW World Tag Team Championship), the first WWF Hardcore Champion, and a one-time TNA Legends Champion. Foley headlined many pay-per-views for WWE from the mid-1990s to the mid 2000s; he participated in the closing matches of WrestleMania XV and WrestleMania 2000 – as a special guest referee in the former.</p>

The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. It is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.</p>
<p>With the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi will host the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Russian Formula 1 Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020 subject to the circuit being ready in time. It is also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.</p>

The muscle is absent in about 14 percent of the population, however this number varies greatly in African, Asian, and Native American populations. Absence of this muscle does not have any known effect on grip strength; however, lack of the palmaris longus muscle is disadvantageous in that its tendon cannot be harvested as a graft if necessary. Some evolutionary scientists maintain that as it is no longer needed by humans, evolution is dispensing with the tendon.</p>
<p>The palmaris longus muscle can be palpated by touching the pads of the fifth and first fingers and flexing the wrist. The tendon, if present, will be very visible.</p>

By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are 366 possible birthdays, including February 29). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions include the assumption that each day of the year (except February 29) is equally probable for a birthday. The history of the problem is obscure, but W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by an "H. Davenport", possibly Harold Davenport.</p>
<p>The mathematics behind this problem led to a well-known cryptographic attack called the birthday attack, which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of cracking a hash function.</p>

<hr><p>This is a redirect from the scientific name to the common name.</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatlus_northropi' >More...</a><hr><h2> Second law of thermodynamics</h2><p>The <b>second law of thermodynamics</b> states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases, because isolated systems spontaneously evolve toward thermodynamic equilibrium—the state of maximum entropy. Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the second kind are impossible.</p>
<p>The second law is an empirically validated postulate of thermodynamics, but it can be understood and explained using the underlying quantum statistical mechanics. In the language of statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations corresponding to a macroscopic state. Because thermodynamic equilibrium corresponds to a vastly greater number of microscopic configurations than any non-equilibrium state, it has the maximum entropy, and the second law follows because random chance alone practically guarantees that the system will evolve towards such thermodynamic equilibrium.</p>
<p>It is an expression of the fact that over time, differences in temperature, pressure, and chemical potential decrease in an isolated non-gravitational physical system, leading eventually to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.</p>
<p>The second law may be expressed in many specific ways, but the first formulation is credited to the French scientist Sadi Carnot in 1824 (see Timeline of thermodynamics). Strictly speaking, the early statements of the Second Law are only correct in a horizontal plane in a gravitational field.</p>
<p>The second law has been shown to be equivalent to the internal energy <i>U</i> being a weakly convex function, when written as a function of extensive properties (mass, volume, entropy, ...).</p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics' >More...</a><hr><!-- 2014-02-06 11:30:08 -0500 -->
